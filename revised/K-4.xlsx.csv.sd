So I have a few questions for you here about basically your everyday life , leisure activities and here on campus and even at home . So I want to know what languages do you typically use with your family , what languages ?
Swahili .
Swahili which other one ?
Mostly Swahili … yeah !
Mostly just swahili yeah . Why , why do you .. Coz I know you speak more than two languages , why do you use swahili ?
Ok the reason as to why I use swahili is because ahh ! One , I think it 's the language that I have been brought up with yeah ! and ah generally ( laughter ) if I may say my dad ni msee wa ghetto he does n’t know as I kaa kikuyu hivo , goso lakini we do n't communicate in English mostly ile once yeah !
Ok , and how about with your friends ? What languages do you use ?
Ok , my friends , it actually depends , it depends , there are certain friends I talk to in English and others I 'll talk to in Swahili , yeah .
Ok , so English , Swahili with your friends , so that , say it depends , what do you mean ? why would you use English with some friends ?
Ok , well it depends , maybe if a friend talks to you in English you have to respond in English meaning that your communication will be based on that . And Swahili generally that is the language that most people most of my friends use actually and maybe Shegg saa zingine yeah .
How about when you are in school ?
School , ok , even in school , it does depends with environment .
Which languages first .
Ok fine mostly English , Swahili and Shegg . They are three yeah .
So what determine when you use which in school ?
The environment , most of the times maybe when am in the studio , maybe I will communicate in English .
When you say studio what do you mean ?
Ok fine , am doing media , and we have a studio down there sometimes I do go present stuff yeah .
So studio it 's English , because is it an English station or ?
It is both English and Swahili , but the environment there , the people you meet mostly you will converse in English but Swahili also .. Yeah .
Aaah .. Do you think it is important for .. for you to know English , for you to know English ?
Well , aah . Yeah I think it is important . aah I tend to think that .
It is important ?
Yeah , it is actually important so just important .
What reasons do you think English is important for you personally ?
First and foremost , our Kenya curriculum our school curriculum , we are tought in English , so we expect everybody to be conversent in English , yeah because of that school , and then the job market out there I think English is formal , formal it is used out there mostly so you have to be able to express yourself in English yah .
Ok , any other place you probally feel you need English , without English you cannot communicate ?
Well , proffesion no . when it comes to the media if I am a news anchor and I am presenting in English , I have to be convesant with English if I do n’t no do n’t that job you know !
How about like from where you come from ? do you encounter tourist , people who can only communicate in English so there is need for you to use English ?
Ok , well I come from Nyeri mount Kenya region and aah .. Yeah people do come there who can only commuicate in English so I think if you know how to communicate in English it 's actually an added advantage because if such people come you can communicate with them yah .
So English is an added advantage for you . Howabout your native language ? Is it important for you to know native language ? Or for anyone ?
My native language is suppose to be Kikuyu . I think it is important yah .. yah .. Its actually very important because as much as we people are studying here in school , we expect later on we are going to give back to our communities where we come from . So Itend to think this people is they are not educated the only language they can understand is the native language and maybe if you are working with an NGO something you want to educate your people or something the best language to communicate is native language the language which people will understand yah . so ittend to think it is very important .
Is it the only reason like that you want to speak to people who do n’t speak English or Swahili , is it that the only reason ? For you who already knows English and you can survive with English and Swahili . This native language , why is important why is it important to you personaly ?
I think a sense of orginality , yah , because if you are a Kalenjin .. ( interapted by interviwer )
So you are talking identity ?
Yah , identity , yah , as in how do you differentiate we are all kenyans we both speak English and Swahili how do you know I am from this tribe ? what do you show ?
so you feel language is something that expresses your identity ?
Yah , your identity .
And what else a part from identity ?
well , I tend to think the sense that you belong to particular groupe of people .. yah . I tend to think that because as much you speak English and Swahili we should understand that this are not our original languages so .. yah . So actually is very important .
Ok , so in eveyday conversation do you mix languages , in conversation ? do you mix languages ?
yah , at certain times you do .
Which languages do you mix ?
Mostly I mix English and Swahili .
So why ? Why would you want mix languages ? what instances are this ?
You know sometime , let me tell you something , you might be talking in English and then aah . Maybe you want to say something but that particular word does n’t click at that particular time you was like " nilikuwa na kwambia yaitwa .. " so you maybe express it in Swahili so that person get what you are saying .
Any other reason why you mix langugaes ?
I also tend to think sometimes it is fun , as in just interesting when you speaking , like there is this word I do n’t know how to put it " I am cud then nikaenda then you know how to clean clothes then I fuad " and stuff yani it 's nice .
Do you plan to mix laguages or it comes to you naturally ?
Not really , sometimes like I told you earlier it depends maybe you do n’t have that particular word at that time , that you speaking so it just come naturally most of the times , it comes naturally lakini sometimes you can plan maybe today we will mix English and Swahili in what terms ? I want you to use that particular way to communicate .
And do you address everyone by mixing languages or there specific people ?
Not really , you know when it comes to mixing languages I tend to think that mostly when you are communicating with your friends because now you are my teacher I cant telling you " teacher you know I did that work lakini I was late in class because I had fuad clothes and stuff ' you know I tend to think ..
So it 's a specific group or is it group or contest ?
As in what do you mean group or a contest ?
If it is aah .. Like a lecturer you do n’t do that to him . How about If it is a parent at home or somebody who is not your lecturer but of a different age at home , do you mix languages with those people ?
Well and aah .. hapo tend to think now the issue of flexibility comes in , you know the way you relate with people you know how different people behave , you know how different people talk , so the way I will talk to you is not the way I will talk to somebody else . So it depends with the person . And mostly pia the contest yah , it depends what you are talking about some seriouse stuff saa zile kuna sense ya formality you do n't do that yah .
So it 's more easly done with your peers ?
Yah , it 's actually done with my peers
And have you noticed any difference between the way you speak and the way other students speak ?
Yah , I have .
what 's the difference that you have noticed ?
Ok , sometimes I can as in the accent , maybe most of the times the way luo 's(tribe ) speak wenye wamekulia uko ndani ndani you tend to .. as in yani deffinetly when somebody speak unajua eeh .. Huyu ni mjaka .. Simply .. ( interapted by interviwer )
So you can tell where somebody comes from , from the way they speak ? Apart from the accent ?
A part from the accent , aah .. Yah pia kama pia tumsee Sheng , kuna different shengs .. ( interviwer interapts )
Sheng here , we are talking about the mixture of English and Swahili .
Yah yani kuna words zingine they are used in aparticular place and other in other places .
So you can tell this person is problelly from this region or the other one you can do that ?
Yah , you can do that .
mmm !! How can u tell ? Like yes you said you can that this person is a Luo(tribe ) , how can you tell just , can you tell me that again ?
From the way a person talks as , in as in kama wajaka(Luos ) most of the time when they are speaking kuna ile accent ya kijaka as in as much as somebody is communicating in English or Swahili unaona ile interference ya mother tounge iko hapo way somebody utters words .
So what you are saying is , when you are talking to somebody you are seeing them , you can tell that this person is from Nyanza ( place in Kenya ) . How about if you can n't see this peson , they are speaking , you just hear can you tell their background ?
Yah , if somebody is speaking that accent , you know as much as we are talking about aah !!!! seeing a person and saa zingine not neccesarily hata ukuwe umemwona huyo mtu , tuseme you are talking to somebody through the phone and this somebody is a Kikuyu kuna the way Kikuyus use ... pia as in unajua definately huyu msee mi mkikuyu as in are you getting my point ?
yes , yes and aah ! other things can you tell this person is of this level of education ? From the way , just hearing may be even on radio or as you said on phone can you tell the level of education or things like political affiliation can you ? How ?
Yeah ,
How ?
Yah , they way somebody talks as in there is a lot you can learn fom that person for instance , when you are talking to somebody maybe not highly educated , when it comes maybe to the English , as in you will gauge the way they talk may be simple words , you do n't expect them to know complex words in English . You are getting ? so I tend to think that aah ! like now the professor is talking , from the way he is atticulating his words from the level he is speaking , you definately know that this peson is highly learned but may be my English is not that good . You are getting my point ? as in yah that is .....
You can tell levels of education ?
Yah , you can actually tell
How about position in societies ?
Positions in the societies ?
Like this is somebody senior , is a manager and another one is just aah !!! House help ? Is it possible to tell those differences from these people ?
Yah , you can , sometimes maybe tuseme you are in a certain home and then you hear somebody commanding " sinilikuambia ufanye hivi and hivi ? " Yaani if somebody is commanding like si hati anarequest ama something you definataely know that this person is the head of that house , you get ? Lakini if somebody maybe is just humble and sikufu you you yeah . From that I tend to think yeah you can tell .
Political affiliation ? anything you can from the way somebody speaks ?
Yah I tend to think thatpolitics actually .
You are free to touch your parties .
Ok fine . When it comes to matters of politics , Kenyans are so sentitive maybe you are discussing about JUBILEE ( political party ) or you are discusing about CORD ( political party ) and the person who as in mwenye yuko so much into Cord loves Raila(Cord leader ) and starts like hata anakasirika you know and from the way he talks you sense that this person is actually mtu wa Jubilee damu you can n't yeah you can n't do anything this person really loves this man na passion and stuff yeah .
So from the language you can tell the background of a person ?
Yah , you can .
Aaah !!! Do you use different languages for different people ?
Yah , like aah I told you most of the times when it comes to communicating maybe with my lecturers , my teachers , maybe the yeah in such an environment I wil speak in English because I tend to think that English is the formal languge yah , when it comes to my friends , my friends wenye yaani we are close tuna weza bonga na hawa Sheng Swahili and .... ( unfinish statement )
Do n’t you think thee are students who will speak to their lecturers in the Slang .
Yah , there are students who do that .
Why do they do that ?
Sometimes it comes unknowingly because your are used to speaking in Sheng(slang ) to anybody .
So it is not continuous .
Yah , you just find yourself speaking .
But you personally you will not never speak in Slang to a lecturer ?
Ok fine . aah !! let me say that Sometimes maybe nikuwe ule unaware kabisa unajua sometimes you do talk lakini ucommunicate na yeye na Sheng yah . Sasa lakini nikiambia besthe yangu hivyo ananiambia what ? your dad ? its like .
They do n’t do that with their .. with their father yeah ?
mmm .. so ..
Oh ok . And aah !!! Have you ever tried to change the way you talk ?
Trying to change the way you talk ?
yeah !
Ok at some point I have ever tried .
Why was that necessary to do ?
Ok fine like now aah !!! In my proffesion I do n’t expect .
Please tell us your profession again ?
Ok fine am not yet am not yet there yeah , yeah
You are trying to be what ?
A journalist .
Go on ..
Aah !! I do n’t expect my language to be like that of a layman I have to communicate in a way that people will understand my message my the way I atticulate my words .
How does a layman speaks ? That you do n’t want to speak like a layman ?
You know I tend to think that in every profession there are ethics you just do n’t speak like now the way you speak to my classmates " wee !! niaje you get in ? " As in rough yah .
And do this lay people speak in certain languges ?
Mostly me .
Forget about the way they speak but they languages ?
Certain languages ?
Yah !!
Mostly tuseme Sheng yeah !!
Mosly Sheng for lay people ?
Yah !!
For a professional what kind of language is more popular ?
English but aah !! Swahili pia .
So are you successfully changing to the way you speak ? The way you talk ?
Ok when it comes to changing the way I talk ok What I actually mean here is that , it depends as in with the field maybe if I am reporting something , if I am reporting something , I will not report it the same way I will act at that field you get in ? they way I encouter and the way I report is different beacuse when you are reporting when you are preporting according to me , it 's me its more like you are reading it to people as in it 's more like you are telling them lakini when you are when you are reporting I tend to think it 's like it 's more of narrating as in you have to make your audience as in you have to capture the attention of the audience .
Ok .
Yah !!
So get the profession abit .
Yah !!
Just in daily life have you ever tried to change the way you talk ? Maybe you encounter somebody and you feel you want to talk in a certain way .
Yah !!
Tell me tell me such incidences
Yah , it does happen sometimes for instance when I meet my luo friends I try to emulate the way they talk yah the reason is to why I do that , is I feel like as in we will communicate better that ’s how I feel I actually feel . I feel that as in everybody will be composed the environment wil be condusive for us .
So will you be trying to accommodate the other your friends ?
Yah !!
Or do they accommodate you ?
Yah , they actually do as in I tend to think that sometimes you meet somebody like now most of my friends are from Coast sometimes you have to switch to that accent so that you are in the same sphere yah , you can communicate yah and get what others are saying .
So what you are telling me is that for reagionally for different regions you change the way you speak .
Yeah , I do , I do I try as much as I do n’t do it like they do but I try .
A part from that any other instance you feel you need to change the language ? Not just based on regions or background of somebody anything else ?
Well aah ! as I told you , I tend to think that Sheng ni different as in according to the place mtu mwenye ametoka so if maybe am speaking Sheng ya particular place and you are from a different place , I will try also to to emulate you as in to speak the way you speak yah at that point I will change they way I speak .
Ok .
Yah !!
What are some of the topics or issues that you discuss with your friends this days ?
Ok you know .
Currently what are you talking about ?
Well , I tend to think what we talk about comes naturally you do n’t plan that today I will talk about this but mostly .
But of late if you remember any topics that have been yah .
Of late politics yeah because .
Politics , what about politics for example ?
What about politics ? like now the MP 's(Members of Perliament ) sijui they wanted to do what the budget and stuff I tend to think that sometimes the current afairs what is actually happening in the country shapes what you are actually going to discuss yah because nikiwa hapa and then nisikie wasee leo budget inasomwa leo and stuff you know I tend to discuss that .
Do you remember any topic you have talked about apart from politics ?
Aaah !!
Do you remember any other topic ?
Profession .
Profession ?
Yah ( agree ) .
what about profession ?
About profession as in like now we are training to be journalist but the course we are doing is not only based on journalism you can work in different areas so its actually a thing that thing we have been discussing lately .
What about Socially ?
Socially in terms of ?
You have told me about profession , you have told me about politics , socially any topics you talk about socially with your friends ?
Yah , maybe how you relate with people , yeah maybe yah how you like maybe when it comes to guys what kind of a guy you would like to date and stuff yah
Dating stuff ?
Yah !!
So you talk about that with your friends ?
Yes .
Why do you talk about politics , why do you talk about dating , why do you talk about , what else did you tell me ?
Profession .
Yah , profession why ?
Well I tend to think it involves what is sorrounding us and what is affecting us directly , yah .
Those are issues that affect you personally ?
Personally yah .
And do you get any feedback from your friends that you feel adding value to your life shaping your ideas ?
Yah !! of course a lot .
Give me some instances , if you have any .
Ok For instance today , we were discussing about guys with my girlfriends and boyfriends both , so we were discussing about guys we were talking about marriage actually and a friend commented that life is not all about money you need a partner who is actually you know , somebody who is lively somebody who is interesting because as much as you get married to a person who has alot of money and you dont just like him you know its going to be hectic so I tend to think there is a lot that you learn when you interact with other people .
You think it ’s a bit too early to think about marriage , you are In first year ?
Yah I am in first year but some issues you have to discuss
So this are the issues that has to do with you life touching your life that you feel are necessary and this are the what ? The current topics that we were talking about ?
Yah !!
And how about shaping political opinion ?
Shaping my political opinion I tend to think that its actually its healthy because there was a time when I was in studio I think it was yesterday breakfast show and then they were discussing about increasing taxation in Kenya and they were saying that maybe the bread will be taxed and stuff you know now according to me it actually affected me politically in the sense that I am a Kenyan .
It did n’t change your political immune or affiliation or affected in a way ?
Ok , fine It actually affected me in a way because they were talking about collecting a million signatures I actually supported that because you do n’t tell me that you are going to tax everybody in Kenya and there are peasants down there who do n’t even afford that bread and then you are like taxing them and at some point they even can n't afford that bread you see so at certain point yeah actually yah .
I get what you are saying . We have talking about your friends its like you are refering to your friends on campus . Is there a difference in terms of topics that you discuss between your friends on campus ? am sure you have friends outside at home . Is there any difference topic wise ?
Yah there is .
What are the topics you discuss ?
For instance when I am here at school most of the topics are actually very formal proffession , politics but some of my finds there at home maybe they do n't go to colleges or universities you know , so they are just there so the things that you discuss with them is actually what is happening around them very informal things .
Like ?
Like , ok fine what do you do nowadays yah or maybe you discuss with them I am sorry to use this word but very irrelevant things because I do n’t expect that friend of mine who has not gone to school . I start telling them about journalism about NGO 's you know I dont expect .
Do n’t you talk to them about your profession ?
Yah !! maybe I can .
Or experience about campus .
Yah I do tell them but mostly the topics that we discuss are very informal .
They are limited ? Even if you talk about profession you do n’t so as much as you do with your friends .
Yah , somebody might loose interest what for as in why are you telling me for ? At the end of the day is not going help me with anything yah .
What is your feeling about language use on campus ?
mmm !! let me see language use on campus ..
Yah ! the way You interract with so many people on campus when you are here how do you feel about generally just tell me anything .
Well , I tend to think that when it comes language use here in campus , at some point it sharpens your languge also for instance maybe sometimes like the way professor was speaking I really admire his English so at a certain point its like motivating me to as in yah , I am admiring that I want to be like him you getting ? and pia saa zingine kuna Sheng zingine when somebody speaks to you are not getting anything because they tend to think that saa hizi hapa campus we are from different places wengine wao yaani inakubambatu and its like I really need to know this yah .
Good , so I know you want to be a journalist when you finish campus , what happens if you do n’t become a journalist ?
Well , ok fine I am not limited to journalism alone I can work anywhere so long as I want to communicate that is actually what I want I want to communicate I tend to think that there are actually things that are happening that are not right and people need to know so in any field that I am and I want to communicate so long as people out there get what I want to communicate am good with that yah . So I am not only limited hata I have to no otherwise it 's all about journalism no .
Thank you very much that will be the end for today yah .
Ok .
