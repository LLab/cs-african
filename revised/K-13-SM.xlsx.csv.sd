… sana kwa mjadala wetu leo .
Poa . ( they both laugh )
Nashukuru sana kwa mda wako .
Sawa .
Umm , tutaongea tu kuhusu-kuhusu lugha na matumizi , katika : nyanja mbalimbali . Iwapo uko na marafiki .. kuna familia , uko shuleni .. mambo kama haya . Kwa hivyo ku : -kuanza , ningependa kukuuliza ni lugha gani ambao hupenda kuongea ama kutumia na familia ?
Familia napenda kutumia : Kiswahili , eeh sababu kila mtu anajua Kiswahili . Eeh . So Kiswahili is more : aah-of the language yenye : - since everybody understands , so you use it .
Mm hmm . Okay , so in your family it means that everybody understands Swahili and Swahili the best ?
Yea , everybody . It cuts across uuh
Kwahivo kumaanisha kuna : -hakuna yule ambae haelewi Kiswahili ?
Hakuna . Kila mtu anaelewa Kiswahili . ( she laughs )
How about friends ?
Friends . Friends I use-even with my family I : use Sheng , and I-I-even friends I use Sheng . I use English and I use Swahili . So it 's a mixture of those .
With your family sio ?
Mm .
Na ukiwa na mabeshti basi ?
Mabeshte ? English , Swahili , Sheng . Family : Swahili , bit of Sheng . Umeelewa ?
Naam . ( they both laugh ) . Okay , in what situations do you use English for friends and Kiswahili for friends or Sheng for friends ? Or maybe what are the reasons that lead you to use ?
It depends on the friends like okay uko huko shuleni . Aah , there are many people who would not know Sheng , so aah- you use-but me , it depends mostly on what language somebody 's-eeh aah-has talked me with . If he or she talks in English I 'll respond in English . Halafu maybe I-I 'll: codeswitch , you see ? And mm : Sheng-Sheng is mostly for people who understand it and aah- na si kwa nia mtu lakini watu wa Nairobi sana sana ndio wanaelewa She : ng ( she laughs ) yenye naongea . So eeh , I think eh-that 's-that 's it . But I know-I know Sheng . Tena nikiongea Sheng huwezi elewa . ( laughs )
Najua , lakini inategemea ni Sheng gani
Oh
Kuna ile Sheng-okay Sheng ya East Lands kama unatoka Dago mi siwezi elewa =
Eeh . Utaelewa ya wapi ? ( she laughs )
Ya kawaida tu . ( she continues to laugh )
So :
Hapa shuleni basi lugha ndio hupenda kutumia ?
Swahili .
Mm hmm .
Yea , Swahili mixed with English . Like the way I 'm talking to you I 'm using Swahili and English most of the time . So , aah shule but ita depend cuz you know ukiongea na lecturer huwezi ongea nae Kiswahili
Mm hmm .
Eeh lakini kuna lecturers wengine wana huongelesha na Kiswahili . So when you 're talking to a lecturer , if the lecturer talks to you in Swahili you stick to ?
Swahili .
You st-you stick to Swahili . If they talk to you in English , you stick to English you do n't codeswitch , you do n’t like say-uuh , maybe lecturer amekuuliza " mm , how was aah , your attachment period ? " " By the way , ilikuwa poa . " Unaona ? No you just answer " it was okay , it was enlightening " you will talk in English . Akikuuliza na Kiswahili .. aah , sijui attachment ni [ uncertain transcription ] Kiswahili lakini " attachment ilikuaje ? " Lakini kuna wenye wako na jina , sasa utaongea naye Kiswahili . So you have to be consistent when talking in formal situation depending on what language the person has talked to you with , unaona ? Akikuongelesha Kiswahili muongeleshe Kiswahili . But there are some lecturers who know Sheng by the way .. - kuna lecturer mmoja ameshaniongelesha Sheng , pia mimi nikamuongelesha Sheng so at least hii ilikuwa poa .
Sheng ile ya ndani ?
Aah , si ile ya ndani , ile tu ya juu juu ( she laughs )
Cuz I could , I would ah really wonder . How about English ? Do you think it 's important to know English ?
Uum : , yea it is very important . English is a universal language . Aah , it 's unifying and then .. most of the world is speaking English or people are striving to know English because it 's now used in most of the formal situations . Halafu ku conduct businesses and then with the usual globalization so English is important cuz how do you conduct business maybe with somebody in:-let 's-let 's say in-in : Rwanda , Rwanda , Rwanda , unaona ? Rwanda , they know Swahili . Rwanda know Swahili ? I do n't know , but let 's assume a country where they-they do n't know Swahili , they do n't know-more obviously hawajui mother tongue yenu , haya . Ni nini watajua ? Watajua English .
Okay .
Unaona ? Na kama hawatajua English watakuwa na translator mwenye anajua English unaona , English is known by-I think people in every country in the world . I think we know English . There are some people who know English so-ah most of the countries , most people know English . Some of the countries like in France , most of them speak French because that is the common language but there are some people even in France who are learning English because maybe they want to conduct business with countries like USA or , unaona ? It 's more of that . Unless somebody anataka kushitukwa country yao . So kama umetoka France na unataka tu [ uncertain transcription ] France hutaki kutoka eti you 're French pekeyake .
You say that English is a language ya biashara .
Mm hmm .
Compare to Kiswahili .
Eeh , compared to Kiswahili ,
Or u-u-how-how much would you rate English and Swahili in terms of its use in business ?
Swahili iko far ( laughs ) , Swahili iko far , Swahili iko down , iko down kidogo compared to English ebu cheki , unaona , English . How many people know Swahili ? If it is not some countries in Africa and not more than half of the countries in Africa know Swahili . Eh ? And yes I 've heard of English being taught in-in countries za majuu but how many people know it ? How do you expect-expect to conduct business with somebody in German-German with-with Swahili . So English is more of a language that hata ukienda Germany umwambie mtu " by the way , eeh nataka ku buy kitu " unaona , you want to buy something then you go talking in Swahili eti which language do you-can you speak ? Maybe you do n't-maybe you do n't know English then you tell that person kwa Kiswahili , seriously ? Unless ukimwabia English hapo hataelewa cuz everybody knows this English and English is more universal . So unaona , unaona hii kitu ?
Naona .
Hata uki balance tu unaona tu English iko na benefits zake .
Sawa . How about a native language ? Do you think it 's important for anyone to know a native language ?
( laughs ) . He ! Sasa , native language . Me it 's not ver-it 's not important . All that native languages do is .. divide people , inaweka watu [ uncertain transcription ] . As in saa nyingine when somebody knows only his native language , he thinks within that scope of a native language-eh-in-maybe say in the-in : Kipsikis , they have a word that dis-that describes a computer . Is there a word in Kipsikis that .. eeh translates to computer , in English , you see ? So you see , the language you know .. it shows your-how you are exposed , aah , how far-how much you are exposed . You know like if you are exposed to the world you know computers , you know ipads , you know everything . Ipads . You know , there 's no word that describes ipads in Kisii my mother tongue . So , according to me people want to be exposed-want to know a language that has these vocabularies , unaona ? Ukikwamilia kujua tu Kisii pekeyake because it is your mothertongue , you end up just being uuh , a bit exposed , kidogo tu . Then you-you are not open , you are just closed-you are closed . So mother tongue is not of importance to me .
Okay . You talk of a mindset and sort of , a language you use to , think in . Which language can you think in ?
Right now I 'm-I 'm thinking in Swahili ( they both laugh )
And you-okay , you 're thinking in Swahili . Why ? Why Swahili and not English ?
I do n't know-I think maybe because Swahili is the lang-is the language-is my first language-is the language that I was taught . I mean it was the language I was born and there are people talking , using it . So now like-so Kiswahili I think that 's why I 'm using Kiswahili to think . I 've never .. found my-no I found myself for a few times-maybe if I 'm doing an assignment , thinking in English or in French . But Swahili most of the times even when I look at you I 'm thinking in Swahili . Maybe I 'm talking-I 'm thinking something about you there , ( laughs ) nafikiria Kiswahili unaona ? Halafu ukiangalia tu nje " By the way hii weather , si poa . Hii weather kunaenda kunyesha " unaona ? Ah it is going to rain , no . [ uncertain transcription ] these things in Swahili .
Hata hivyo kwahiyo huchanganya lugha ?
Sana .
Mm . Kwanini na katika situations gani ?
Okay lugha muchanganya saa zingine .. -nimesahau word . By the way , saa nyingine unasahau jina , maybe ulikuwa unatakakusema … " eeh nataka kwenda ku buy : " Maybe you want to buy something like , aah : an electric kettle . Unaona ? Nataka kwenda kununua electric kettle . What is electric kettle in Swahili ? I do not know . Coil ? I do not know . Eeeh , heater ? I do not know . You see , so it 's convenient for me to change because I do not know the vocabulary of this word in the other language so I mix both languages depending on the knowledge I have in that language . There 's some words I do n't know in English , that 's why I use Swahili so that somebody can understand what I 'm trying to say .
Okay .
Yea .
So which languages do you tend to mix most ?
Swahili and English .
Okay .
Uum .
Those are the two languages you-you mix most ?
Yea , I mix most . Yea . Swahili and English mostly then maybe Sheng and Swahili , second mostly . ( laughs )
Kwako wewe , umeangalia tofauti kati ya vile unavyoongea na ambavyo watu wengine wanavyoongea ?
Kuna tofauti . Aah , tofauti iko in that-in Kenya , speak-even in all over the world . Speaking depends-how you talk depends on , where you come from , or your first language , what you 're exposed to .
That 's true .
Let me say what I 'm exposed to-i-maybe-you know if I was a child and then they took me to France . Si ninge grow up kama najua tu French halafu hio ntakuwa tu na hiyo accent ya French . Hiyo-hiyo-hiyo accent yenye : -ie- it 's nice ya French unaona ? I 'm exposed to that environment . So when you-when you find a : Kikuyu talking that one from huko ndani ndani , huko [ uncertain transcription ] , what . Eeh . Huyu ukipata huyu Mkikuyu na upate Mkikuyu wa-um-na upate Mluo , the way they 'd speak English is very different .
That 's right .
Depending by the way , depending on where they come from . Maybe they are-they have grown up in urban areas then you 'll not know the difference but kama ni-ni wa ota , you 'll know the-the difference that this one is speaking in-aah-this way . So I 'll know that this one is a Kikuyu and this one is a Luo . So ntajua , unaona ? So the way I speak is different from the way another person speaks . By they way our voices are-are very unique . You 'll never find two voices which are-which are similar . Okay that 's-that is beside the topic but-by the way the way we speak is different , but it is influenced by our mother tongue and what you are exposed to and maybe things that we 've experienced also somehow changes the way we speak . Maybe umekuwa na home- ukiwacha hiyo ( laughs )
Na , okay , ulishaona watu wenye-wanajaribu kuiga ? Wanajaribu like ku imitate watu wengine ?
Comedian ?
What is the motivation , for them to imitate or like speak like those people ? What is the motivation , what makes them to want to speak like those people ?
Maybe it 's because a-a certain-a-okay speaking is more of accent si ndio ? So certain people feel like another accent is more prestigious . I 'll give you an example of not very far away from Kenya . Let 's-let 's go to : Britain . Britain there 's the : Queen's accent . It 's-it 's seen as more pre-prestigious than the other accents . The other accents are more-are substandard . So mtu akijua hiyo accent ya queen anaonekana ako juu- so unaona mtu ana-anajaribu kuongea hivo . Same when you come in Kenya , you find people trying to speak like from the nose . Like " Hii . How are you : ? " " I 'm fine " " What , what , what , what ... what you doing ? " Hivo vitu vingine ( laughs ) . Sasa , you see somebody ana try even me can by the way if-ka- kanikienda Westi si na pretend tu mi ni mtu wa huko na naongea from the nose . Like I 've come from , aah , maybe I was studying in Europe or something like that . So you see , I 'm trying to say people try to imitate the way other people speak because of the association , eh ? The accent is prestigious , it 's considered prestigious [ uncertain transcription ] US ama sijui ulikuwa wapi ni hivyo sasa unaona eh ?
That 's right . Na .. pia mtu akiongea , uweza : tambu ya-ya kwamba huyu mtu anatoka sehemu fulani ya nchi . Na haswa wale wa sehemu yako , wale ambao wanatoka kwenu ( she starts to laugh ) unaweza jua kwamba { ni wa kwenu} =
{ Mi naweza jua } kabisaa ! Naweza jua mi najua wenye Wakisii wanaongeaga lakini siwezi wa imitate ( laughs ) , ni ngumu .
Ni nini hufanya ungumu . [ Uncertain transcription ] kwamba hawa watu wanatoka sehemu fulani ?
Like many times I hear people speaking ninasema " ah ! Huyu ni Mkisii " unaona ? There 's that way they t-t he accent . The way they-they pronounce English words or Swahili words is more of Kisii 'ish , unaona . Unajua huyu ni Mkisii , huyu ni Mluo , unaona ? The way maybe wanang 'oa pia , eeh , you find that maybe a-a Kisii , well , what Kisii-Kisii wanasemanga maybe kama ' lori ' wanasema ' rori ' , aah , then mm , I forgot [ uncertain transcription ] but wana [ uncertain transcription ] ' l ' na ' r ' , aah , na ' k ' . Da , dada , tata , tata yangu . Yani dada . T and D is a problem , unaona ? So you know by the-the way they pronounce certain-le-eeh , certain words that will tell you this one is a Kisii , this one is a Luo so-yea , it 's easy for me to know . But for those people whose first language is not Kisii , will not know . Mm .
That 's right . How about if you overheard somebody talking over the radio . You 've not seen these people . Can you , maybe tell their kind of background they 've had ? Maybe the level of education ? Can you then tell their political affiliations or their level in the society ?
Unaona sasa hiyo-hiyo kitu ya-ya nanii-ya : -hiyo ya radio , many times I listen to the radio but unless the station is a local station , then huwezi- most of the-of the-of the radio stations are hiring people whose accent is-has not been interfered by mother tongue by the way . Kama uko na interferance ni vigumu waku hire , kwa- this national radio stations .
Maybe just a clarification-a clarification . Bef-I mean uh , away with the presenters . But now , if somebody just .. [ uncertain transcription ] over the radio , this is the representer , maybe somebody is being interviewed or is talking about some issue , can you tell maybe this issues , that I have just listened , the level of education , the position in society , the political affiliation ?
Yea it is easy to know because of poli-okay let me start with the level of education because the language you speak will .. most definitely give away ( laughs ) where you 've reached in education for most people , most people there 's some people who it 's hard to know but most of them the-their vocabulary , the words , their vocabulary unaona ? Ulichukua affiliation you just know because of the-of : the acc-the person who is being interviewed the accent , unaona ? If the person speaks in a manner that suggests that this person is a Luo , you know they support more CORD . If they speak in a manner that this one is a Kikuyu you 'll know they support Jubilee most of the people because there 's some people who do n't support these parties that we think they support . So hivyo ndio naona : Nime answer your question ?
Yea , kwa hivyo wewe unawezasema kwamba unaongea lugha tofauti kwa watu tofauti ? Na ni kwasababu gani ?
Watu tofauti , if I 'm close to you , I 'm likely to speak aah Swahili . I 'll-I 'm likely to code- to codeswitch most of the time because I want to bring out the solidarity that we have between us . But if I 'm not close to you I 'll just speak one language consistently , I 'll try my best to-to consistently speak one language . Mm .
Okay . Apart from the relationship that you have with the person , how else can you say that you speak different ah languages to different people ?
Apart from the relationship ?
Yea ,
Maybe the environment , if it 's the formal environment I 'm more likely to speak English consistently . Mm , relationship nimesema si ndio ? The relationship we have , maybe then the class . Your class in the society will-will matter . I can n't just aah .. approach aa person maybe like a- the VC then speak to him in Swahili . I do n't think I can unless it is Swahili sanifu . But most people associate these big people with English . So you just approach them speaking to them in English . But kama ni mtu tu labda mfa-mtu wa shamba , aah maybe housekeeper , you 'll-you are more likely to speak to them in Kiswahili . And then ah , speaking a-a-like a language like English in some situations i-i-it is very strange . It 's-it might sound strange for lack of a better word . Strange , no strange is better anyways . Strange because like speaking to a makanga conductor in English surely , hata watu watakuangalia " kwani huyu anajaribu ku show nini " unaona ? So , I think ita depend na mtu pia .
Umeshajipata na-ushajipata kwa situation you 've met a stranger , halafu maybe you do n't know the-the kind of person this stranger is . And have you struggled to like choose the kind of language to use ?
A stranger ? Uuuh =
Na ni nini will determine the kind of language that you use ?
The way they person is dressed , like the way you 're dressed I 'm more likely to speak to you in English because you 're official , unaona ? Or Swahili sanifu throughout . Also your age will matter . If I- for example [ uncertain transcription ] with white hair and then I 'm speaking to them in Sheng mixed with Swahili that will sound , will be-will not be a-according to- unaona-inaonekana- the way you 've dressed , your age .. ah , mm .. the way you 've dress is more likely the-your grooming . If somebody is shaggy , shaggy , shaggy you 're likely to speak to them in Swahili or Sheng or , yea . Somebody looks rough . Somebody looks polished , refined , English . So I think that 's what eh , ukimuona tu unajua huyu =
Ni Kiingereza .
Mm . Like that day when you wanted to do-to do an interview with us , you were dressed in a-in a-in a sweater . You were more like English English eh ? " How is it going to take ? It 's going to take how long ? Twenty minutes so .. " You , you get ? I think { you get }
{ Poa . } ( they both laugh ) Then um , another issue maybe . Have you ever tried to change the way you speak ? I mean the way you talk ? And why ?
Many times ( laughs ) .
Kwanini ?
Many times I 've tried changing the way I talk , the way I speak . Ah , maybe if I go to a new environment I 'll try to speak like them . Mm , to-I want to fit in to a certain group . I go-I-I go to maybe aah mtaani , naenda- may-maybe ku buy mboga ama kitu kaa hiyo then I meet a friend of mine , wa mtaa tu . Then ntaanza kumuongelesha Sheng " Niaje ? niaje bro ? niaje sis ? " unaona ? " Niishia makoi hivi ku buy mboga " huh ? Halafu ananiuliza " muthama akoaje ? muthama ako poa ? "
Muthama ni ?
Mom , mother .
Okay .
Aah , halafu maybe ananiuliza about aah my sister , my sister is ' mutasiis ' . " Mutasis akovipi ? " Namwambia " Ako poa " unaona ?
Eh hee .
Unaona ? You see ?
Na get ( laughs )
( She laughs heartily ) So unaona hiyo ni ya-hiyo ni ya huyo-huyo sasa . Nimebadilisha unaona ? Kutana na mwingine maybe-eeh , nimekutana-nimepita hivi nikakutana na high school teacher wangu , sh-all of a sudden sasa nataka kumwonyesha nimefika university unaona ? Nianze kumwongeleshaje Kiswahili ? [ uncertain transcription ] But then niko Uni , nini , nini unaona ? " Yea , hi teacher . I 'm okay , mm hmm . I 'm in my final year . I 'll be finishing-I 'm doing linguistics media and communications " unaona ? So you have to sound more of learned , huh ? Learned . Umalize na mwalimu , maybe I-maybe I meet maybe my-mostly I think my mom . My mom likes Swahili . I 'll speak to my mom in Swahili which I 'll-and I 'll change-I 'll also change-accent pia itabadilika , unaona ? And then maybe I meet some people who are speaking English . Maybe in school . I 'll speak the same English , unaona ? Ntabadilisha . Ntabadilisha venye naongea pia . Maybe they 're-by the way I 've met so many people wanajaribu kuongea hiyo Kizungu ya-ya nose . Mm ? " I 'm gonna go shopping " um , " with my friends or something like that " . Then unaingilia unasema " wow , that 's niice " , unaona ? Unajifanya tu pia una-ndio u fit , ndio ukuwe accommodated kwa huyo-hako ka group , unaona ? Usi feel out . So I think it 's more of trying to fit into a certain group that will-that almost likely changes the way I talk .
Unaona ni raisi ku fit in those groups ama ni kama una struggle ?
Eh groups nyingine ni raisi nyingine ni ngumu ( laughs ) kama zile za Kizungu ! Ey we ! Huwezi pretend for long , huwezi pretend for long . By the way [ uncertain transcription ] afadhali tu usiingie cuz kuna katoo place kama kuna best wangu mwingine hapo , alikuwa amejaribu ku fit kwa group . And then these people they went ah-in Nairobi . They went in a [ uncertain transcription ] Center , then eh , they went to : this a place , a burgers place hapo tu juu .. Then , she 's-she 's asked aah , if she 'll like to take milkshake .
Okay .
Milkshake . Milkshake ni nini jameni . Ha ! ( laughs ) unaona ? So you 'll find yourself that there 's those questions that you cannot answer kwasababu umeji-ume pretend ati-unaja-una =
Uko kwa hiyo group .
Eh uko kwa hiyo group .
We ndio mwenyeji .
We ndio-ey ! Wapi ! Unapatikana
Hua , okay . Umm , apart from that . You and your friends , mnaongea ma issues gani siku hizi ?
Aah , siku hizi issues more , inaonekana ma boy .
Aah ?
I 'm more like , sinilikuambia ? Okay , sikukwambia ( laughs ) . I 'm like-I 'm more like of a person who gives advice to people in relationships . By the way people come to me for relationships advice . I 'm good at that . So mi ni-mi nakuaga tu eh , yule mtu wa " by the way , unafaa fanya hivi na hivi na hivi " .
Uh huh .
" Na hivi na hivi na hivi " unaona ? So that 's why people like coming to me and I give them what , straight . Nawaambia " if this does n't happen then this is likely to be the result " Unaona ? So , okay . So hiyo ni story ya ma boy . Maybe fashion . Eh ? Mtu anakuja kwamba " By the way , huoni hizi boots zenye zimetokea ? Eh , ni poa si ndio ? " " Eeh , ni poa " . Fashion . But mostly it 's about boys and men . ( laughs ) They 're different .
Mm hmm .
Then we also talk about politics . Mostly with guys . Guys like stories of politics . Eeh , like you meet a guy then they tell " Did you vote ? " That 's the first thing they 're asking you . And then unamwambia " Aah by the way mi siku vote kwenye [ uncertain transcription ] " , unaona ? Cuz kunammoja alikuwa ameniambia nivotie CORD , lakini sikuvotini . Nikamwambia " by the way nimevotianga CORD " by that time nilichangingi mind lakini ni haja yakushinda , hii si poa . Unajaribu ku-ku-kuona-kuona hiyo side yake ndio asi feel vibaya . Eeh .
Okay . How about these issues that you talk it 's different across gender ?
It 's different across gender and also-mm it depends on how close we are . You cannot tell me somethings zenye ni-zenye ziko very private unaona ? There 's some things I can .. tell you , there 's some things I cannot tell you . It depends on how close we are . If you 're very close I 'll not tell you mm-if you 're very close I 'll tell you most of the things , mostly private . Private , private things unaona ? So aah- ina depend closeness . Closeness .
Sawa . Sawa .
Eeh , tha t-t hat one will-will influence what we talk about .
Ok .
So ndio mana mtu asijam . Kama sijakwambia kitu asijam , kwasababu hatuko close sana . ( laughs )
Poa . Nashukuru sana kwa mda wako .
Oh , zimeisha ?
Eeh .
Haraka , poa . Sawa .
Asante .
Okay , you 're welcome .
