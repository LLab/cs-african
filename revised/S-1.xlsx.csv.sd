Pronounciation ?
EHHE . Yes .
Uma uthi olimini , i vocabulary nama grammar ne pronounciation- khona ukuthi kwenzanjani ?
Kuya- kuyayekwehluke khona impela khona ngoba noma uthole ukuthi umuntu usho into oyaziyo ehhe kodwa yena ayibize ngelinye igama . Yabo ? Uthole ukuthi esigodini sabo babiza into ethize ihluke kuneyakho . Nina nithi-
I prefer ukuthi ama answers akho uwaqale nge English because labantu bayi English kakhulu . otherwise uma sesi transcriber we are going to have a problem .
Oh : we are going to have a problem ? Oh , okay .
If you just heard someone talk without without seeing this person could you tell what kind of background he or she had e.g. their level of education , position in society , political affiliation , etc ? Uyakhuluma lomuntu , awumboni , would you tell i background yakhe ukuthi oh this is =
Ya , I 'm sure because it differs , the way we talk it differs . If i level of education yakho ingekho high , it 's not high then- nendlelokhuluma ngayo nayo izozwakala . Uma engale ngizozwa ukuthi oh okay that 's the professor speaking because uzobe ekhuluma kwi level e high . Uzozwa ngendlela akhuluma ngayo ne grammar yakhe nani nani .

EHHE , ikwi level e high kodwa futhi umangabe engafundile uyezwa ukuthi oh okay i education yalo iphansi . Ngendlela azokhuluma ngayo .
Kodwa kwenzeke uthole ukuthi omunye umuntu , ku depender ukuthi ukhuluma nobani , umuzwe uma ekhuluma ngale , uthole ukuthi ukhuluma nomuntu ongafundile then yonke into yakhe ibe phansi . Uyuzwe ukuthi kuyenzeka lokho ?
Ayehlise naye ? Kuyazenzakalela ?
Yabona uma- uma ngisuka ngiya ekhaya ? Ngiyemakhaya ? I 've noticed ukuthi emakhaya bangijaja ngalokho ukuthi , lo uyahamba hambe ayedolobheni kodwa uma ebuya , uthebuya laba abasikhulumela ulimi esingalwazi , avele akhulume isiZulu nje .
Avele akhulume isiZulu phaqa ?
EHHE , phaqa . Ungafihli .
So if ungale ngeke ngizengizwe ukuthi ufundile ?
Cha because ngizobe ngizikhulumela nje . Uma ethi uthi , ngimane ngizikhulumele into yasemakhaya impela .
But still nalapho- still kodwa- kodwa umu- umuntu ofundile even if it 's our African languages , if it 's Zulu or Sotho or whatever . Nalo luyahluka ulimi .
EHHE

Nango-ke u- when- ukuthi when a person speaks , does not speak Zulu then I would switch . And kade sikhuluma manje ngendaba yasemakhaya .
Eh .
Uma uzokhuluma uphendula before uphendula , do you ever check where you are ukuthi ngilaphi ?
I think it happens automatically .
Abanye abantu abaku-checki lokho like look at our politicians , look at our politicians . Basuka la baye emakhaya bayofunda iphepha , bayokhuluma nabantu basemakhaya , uyamthola umuntu usekhuluma isiNgisi . It depends who you are .
Yoh . Maybe it depends (…) who you are because-
Uthole uGatsha nangasemakhaya ukhuluma isi-
If ngisemakhaya why would I speak English ngoba- kufanele ngikhulume isiZulu ngoba- half yalabobantu ngeke i understand ukuthi =
Ya , why , i question yethu is why do you have to speak differently to different people ?
Angazi ukuthi usuke ushintshelani . But ukuthi mhlawumbe , enne , ukuthi i- i- mhlawumbe it 's because we take for granted , we think ukuthi everyone is educated in this day and age . Whereas kusanabantu who are not educated .
And so you consider that factor that there are people who are still not educated therefore you adapt your levels to =
Yeah , you adapt .
Have you ever tried to change anything about the way you talk and why ?
No , no .
Why ?
Why should I change ? I do n't see why I should change . I know they speak nice , like I said ukuthi mina ngifunde e location . Eh , I do n't see why I should change the way I speak because these younger kids they speak like =
You just want to remain who you are ?
I just want to remain- it 's the only way I know how .
What are the issues that you and your friends talk about these days and why ?
Issues about ?
Topical issues , these days . Whatever political or social issues . Political issues , social issues , whatever issues , economic issues . Ama issues nje enikhuluma ngawo .
Socially ? Socially sikhuluma ngani ? Sihlale sikhuluma ngamadoda . ( both laughing )
Ukuthi- what have they done . Always talking about men .
Sikhuluma about amadoda- man ukuthi i age =
About their scandals ?
No , especially thina we are single ukuthi we like- what 's happening with men ?
Ukuthi why- but that 's important to say what has happened to men .
MH
Men do not want to propose or men do not want to marry .
They are not serious , they do n't want i commitment .
When are they going to be commitment =
I commitment .
Commitment .
Iyenanto esihlala sikhuluma ngayo nje ukuthi hhawu bantu we almost forty , thirty plus .
Men , nowadays do not want to commit .
EHHE (…) and si thirty plus .
And why , why do you have to talk about that ?
Why not ? I age yethu- I 'm close to forty .
Because you come from a family and you feel you should be having a family ?
Nami I deserve to have a family by now . It 's late . But kodwa-ke they do n't . anyway-
Continue with follow up questions eh- that feel natural to you . What do you want to talk about ? Just continue with follow up question that you feel natural to you that you want to talk about .
Siy 'khulumele nje ?
Ehhe . And code switch free . Be free . If it 's not men or maybe you discuss that issue ukuthi =
No , eyamadoda is a lost cause .
It 's a lost cause ?
It 's a lost cause .
Okay , any other issue ?
Eh (…) Enye into esiyaye sizikhulumele ngayo ikhona ukufunda , how important it is ukufunda . Mh- most of us =
Ukuthi at the end of the day whether you have a man or you do n't have a man but if you are able to survive and if you have kids , as long as- because at times siyayesithi- eh (..) do n't try to rob yourself , ungatholi ingane ngesikhathi okufuneka ube nengane ngayo because you 'll solve your way because sekufike i age you thought you 'll only start having kids once ushadile .
Ehhe .
Uthole ukuthi =
Awufiki umshado
Awufiki umshado , and then you do n't have kids . Uyabona ? That is the question that keeps coming up . I remember interviewing women at one stage when I wanted to get married , I ended up interviewing women and asking them ukuthi " how old are you ? " " I 'm thirty , thirty two , thirty five " , and " why do n't you have a child because you are already thirty five ? " " Do you realize that i gap between now and forty ukuthi it 's just five years ? "
Eish .
Athi , ya I thought I would get married =
Get married first .
Ya , first and then- Okay , " do you have a house ? " No . " Do you have a car ? " No . And so i age yonke lezizinto uyazibona ukuthi ziyahamba lezizinto ? Do you think you 'llstart thinking about a house when you are not married , when you are married ? How if lento ingafiki ?
What about- you do n't get married ?
It was like- it used to be a serious issue because such that omunye umuntu wangibuza ukuthi kodwa ungazi ungibuze yonke ye questions , ucabanga ukuthi that ndoda othi ithe wozongi interviewer- ingi-interviewela ukuzobuza yonke lemibuzo le . Yazi ukuthi zi sensetive ezinye zalezinto lezi , yabo ? Because I used to interview them as if ngiba interviewela omunye umuntu othile who wants to get married , yabo ?
Oh-
Kodwa ngiba interviewela mina , yabo ? Omunye I 've been referred to them , ngiyakhumbula ngarefeywa kwi- It was a- it 's a family counselling nani nani nani , ngiye lapho and so i advocate lapho- family advocate and the counsillor they ended up bringing this issue bethi no , how did you get married to lomuntu ok 'hlaza kanje ? HHE ? Then baqala lapho bathi thina we can organize with- thina we got friends kanje kanje . And then I started interviewing these friends babo-
Oh , ya ya , ya-
Ngiba interviewer manje ngibabuza ukuthi kanje kanje kanje . Uyambona umuntu ukuthi- right , ufuna ukuba nezingane ezingaki between now and forty-
Forty .
Athi ngifuna ukuba na three . Uzomthola kanjani because-
Within short period of time .
Omunye umbona lapho ukuthi akekho organized lomuntu . Omunye would have before aze abenengane- before abe nani- Ngokufunda , uthe i education is important .
Important ya .
She would have studied then when you are- study hard and unama opportunities ubone ukuthi azoba maningi ama opportunities because wonkumuntu ufuna umuntu ofundile-
Umuntu onama qualification .
Although , i education- high education yona is a stumbling block because once you are too educated , male do not want you because wazi too much . Abantu abaningi bafuna umuntu wesifazane onjani , o submissive and you are not going to be submissive .
Because you are educated .
Uma ngabe wazi uMpume Zondela , I said to Mpume , eh- you are in trouble my girl because you have a PhD , you have a beautiful car , and le boyfriend onayo , ibambisise because you will never- they will never stop you .
And baba intimidated .
Abantu besifazane- abantu besilisa they get intimidated easily abantu besifazane . Abamfuni umuntu such that okulelizinga , laphaya . Umuntu la obona khona ukuthi umuntu okwazi uku approach a labobantu is umuntu ongafundile because yena i- imfundo yakhe incane and so wazi ukuthi umuntu wesifazane- umuntu wesifazane kuyena umuntu wesifazane , wena ubona i class yena akayiboni le class oyibonayo .
Yes , yes , yes .
That is the main problem la ekhona in this society . Ukuthi-
Kodwa vele I think i society , I do n't know ukuthi sizoyishintsha kanjani imiqondo yethu sonke . I think it 's the society that esikuyona especially us as women . Ukuthi , I mean seriously , why should I be worried about my age ukuthi I 'm aging whatever whatever , no man is proposing . It 's i pressure from society , from families . The first thing they see me my relatives , when they see me , when are we seeing umkhwenyana ? Why is he not marrying you ? Is it up to me ?
Enye ilokuzana , I like that because you have raised another issue , you are saying is it up to me ?
Uyayibona leyonto ?
Uyazi ukuthi enye i problem that is exactly what I used to say in those interviews ukuthi , i problem esinayo I feel ukuthi more so the kids , even my daughters ukuthi , ukuba babe ama feminists because a feminists does not wait for umuntu wesilisa ukuthi a propose . When are you going to ilontuzana- ube brave uthi so and so , iyaphi lendlela ? It 's not taking us anywhere and therefore siyadlala nje . Nisho nidlala kanje nithi , I no longer want you as a boyfriend kodwa i boyfriend engayazi i future ukuthi iyaphi-
Engena direction .
Engena direction . Empeleni , udlala kabi . Sidlala kabi . When are you proposing or what , should I propose ?
Ay , then after that ubukeka- as pushy and warawara .
No , you are not pushy you are just- uyisho futhi ilokhuzana , hhayi ukuthi- uyisho- ungayisho umubi ukuthi you are bitter-
Serious .
Yabona , I 'm not bitter , I 'm just saying , uyabona ?
I do n't ukuthi where is this going .
Let 's stop this story .
