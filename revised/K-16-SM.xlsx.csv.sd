Dialogue
… language and language use .
Mm hmm .
And to begin that , we want to know-ok . Which kind of language do you normally use ?
What kind of language ?
With your family ? Yea . With your family .
With my family ? Kipsigis . I am a Kipsigis . So , that is the first language that we use .
Mm hmm .
Otherwise secondary language is-will be : Kiswahili , a bit of English and between my siblings and me , might be Sheng . Yes .
Mm hmm . Why would we want to use Kipsigis ?
Kipsigis .
When you are with your family ?
It 's , mother tongue . So it 's the first language that I learned … so : and since they understand that better , I tend to use it .
Oh , so the-the fact that they understand that language better ?
Yes .
Uuh , is the reason that makes you to use the same language ?
It is uhh-it is something we have in common . It is something out of-it is something I 'm not-let me ss-let me not say I 'm not used to . It 's something , that will : bring some kind of bond . If we are to use English , English will remind you of another situation of a class situation . Kiswahili will also remind you of a more stricter situations , formal situations . So the ideal language to use here is Kipsigis . That is between me and my parents . And then for the Sheng , me and my brothers , my sisters , they understand the language . And since .. the kind of education system that we 've all gone through-of-all gone through , somehow somehow along the way we picked that Sheng language . So , something that also .. will : -separates them and my parents . My parents will not undershen-understand Sheng . Me and my brothers or my sisters will understand Sheng . So brings about that difference =
So in instances where you want to exclude your-your parents ,
Yes .
You 'll resort to Sheng ?
Yes . You : do not want them to hear the conversation that you 're having you use Sheng .
Wh-what kind of a situations would make you use Sheng ?
Sheng ? First of all , we are the Y generation ( smiling ) and my parents if not X , maybe a generation before that ( both are smiling ) . So as a Y generation-every generation has their own kind of language , by the way . And for the Y generation trust me , Sheng has to come in . Yea . So that is why we use Sheng . And then eh : , what have you said ?
I 've just-I 've just asked . Ok , maybe .. what topics maybe would you be discussing so that you want to exclude your parents ?
Umm , what kind of topics ? Anything-may-ok-I might be saying something that my parent did not do or did and I want to exclude them . I will use the Sheng . Or I will : use the Sheng also when uuh , they have n't done something for me and I want them . So I 'm first seek-seeking the opinion of my brothers or my sisters before I go and present the case .
Okay .
Yes .
So sometimes you think-okay they are understanding of what you want to say might be offensive or something ?
To them . Yes . They might reject so I have to seek for a way that when I go and present it to them , they are going to accept . Yea so I just have a discussion with my brothers or my sisters first of all " If I go and tell them like this watakubali ? Eh , unaonaje ? Eh { ama nini } = "
Saa unatatafuta maoni =
So you seek for opinions first of all .
Na ukiwa na marafiki zako , huwa unatumia lugha gani ?
Which friends ? Here ?
Maybe-okay wherever you are =
Wherever I am =
How many-or which kind of friends do you have ?
Mm , the kind of friends-by the w-yea it also depends on the kind of friends that you have . If you have friends who mind-by the way , I 'm not very good in Sheng . That one I will not lie so , instances that-okay most of the instances I will tend to use English or Kiswahili . And since Kiswahili is more structured , it 's ngumu kidogo ( she laughs ) English will be the ideal language to use here . As for the Sheng , this that one time when you have those yo-yo people , those kind of yo-yo friend and , you kind of want to fit in or you kind of want to accomodate them . Yea , not actually fit in you kind of want to accomodate their talk .
Okay .
Because there are people who just come and tell you in Sheng , and since you do not want to put off the person , or you want to listen to what they are saying . You do n't want to cut off that communication immediately , so I will accommodate them with the kind of language they 've approached me .
Okay .
In instances that I do not understand I 'll just have to ask for a clarification .
So you can say that you : normally fit in their language system or they fit in yours ?
It can be either way . Yes . If I 'm using English and I see that it 's a person who .. does n't know English or a person who their language is just limited to the Sheng , then I will try and accommodate them so that they can-I can fit in theirs . I 'm the one accomodating but I 'm trying to fit in theirs . But if it 's somebody who understands English , sometimes they could just be talking in their Sheng or whatever it is that they 're using and I can be using my English or my Kiswahili as long as there 's that kind of communication . Yes .
How about here in school , which language do you use ?
In school . First of all , I : use-I 've used first of all severally , ( she laughs )
It 's allowed .
It 's allowed . Okay . I use English . Most of the settings are official . Half of-three quarters of what we actually do here is official business and English is the best language to conduct official business . And now since I 'm used to that English I will tend to be using English most of the time . But I also use Kiswahili other times if I know how to structure it . Or sometimes I just break it as long as the message is home . And Sheng also , yes . Though I 'm not very good in it but I try somehow . And then there 's this French . Yes , I also : speak in French , at times . While not forgetting =
Interesting .
( she laughs ) Not forgetting Kipsigis . If you meet somebody you share-somebody . Somebody from home or somebody who knows your language . You know there is that sense of connection there is that sense of bringing closer to home so I will tend to use the Kipsigis . So I use all of them . Those are like five .
English , do you think it 's important to use English , to know English ?
Mmm , it is important to know English . It is uuh , it 's a source-it 's sort of a connection between you and any other speaker who does not understand any other of those languages that I , I mentioned : English , French , Ki-no , not English sorry . Kiswahili , French , Sheng and Kipsigis . And , if it 's an official kind of situation , I will use Englislh . Yea . So English is important . It is .
So-so you think English is .. is used for official matters ?
Yes .
So-but they 're in hostels when you speak English you are-{it 's not so much official } .
{ It is something official } . No . When I speak in English back in my hostel it is something I 'm used to . Yes English is an official language and if you tend to use something more often you get used to it , so I will use it not necessarily to conduct something official but because I 've been used to the English . And then in my-if my vocabulary in this other language is limited , the choice would be English . Yes . But occasionally mixing it with maybe Kiswahili , Kipsigis .. French for those French speakers who understand or if you 're really feeling French , yes . ( she laughs )
And uh , you talk about French . Now when maybe you meet your-your-your fellow colleagues who-who speak French or whom you-you learned French together in-in class . Which language is so spontaneous ? Or so spontaneously comes to you and you start speaking ?
" Umemaliza kazi " that 's an example of a situation if you meet somebody . Eh he , of course you have { one of those things that you share } . ( lightly laughs as she 's talking )
{ And you-you 're talking to } a French speaking person ?
A French speaking person . Eh ! Now that French speaking person it depends . If it 's a teacher , you will try . You do n't disappoint them by : -and so you try and throw in some French words there , some English words there . But if it 's a student and maybe you 'll-the kind of structure that you want to use in French . Maybe the kind of sentence that you want to construct is hard . It 's clear you-the wan t-t he word-the kind of sentence you want to construct is hard , I 'll just use Kiswahili or English . Yes .
Now back there in the hostels do you have students who understand French maybe ?
I have a classmate who lives there ,
Okay .
And I assume that with that very little knowledge that she has of French I can communicate to her something once in a while in French .
Okay . Now when you communicate using French do you feel that you are being so official yet you are there in an informal setting ? You are in the hostel .
No , I-I do n’t feel-feel official . I feel like I 'm: trying to .. practice my language of French ( laughs ) which is something very good .
So you can treat French just like any other language , English-I mean eh , Kiswahili and Sheng ?
Practice makes perfect . ( she laughs ) . So I tend to-yea , if you are practicing . But English , hiyo English . English you 've been learning it all through , eh ? Even you . I am sure the kind of education that umepitia imekuwa tu Kiingereza , all along . And then , we were colonized by who ? The Britons . And they 're the ones who brought that English along with them . So , there was , there 's no way I 'm going to compare English and eh , my use of English and my use of Kipsigis , or my use of French . French it is something I-I have just acquired the other day . Okay , maybe it might have been in primary . But i t-t here are no-not many situations require me to use French . But the English informs in wherever-in the currencies-in everything it is English . So I view it as a more formal language than those other languages .
French included ?
Mmh .
Now talking of a native language , do you think it is important for anyone to know a not-a native language ?
Yes . By native you mean now like Kipsigis ?
Yea . Mean-yea , your mother tongue .
My mother tongue . It is important . You have to have come from somewhere you just did n’t fall from the sky with English . Yea . Soo , nat-ahh native language is important it gives you that sense of identity of belonging to somewhere .
You have-here in school you have heard or experienced some students who-who may not have a native language . What do you think they miss as compared to you who has a native language ?
Mmm . It depends on the kind of language that they first acquired . If-if uuh , the situation-if wherever they were they spoke their English first or they spoke Kiswahili first , that is the language-that actually would be their first language . But if I acquired Kipsigis first , that is my first language then the kind of people that you 're also around if they 're speaking Kipsigis , you will get the vocabulary for that language for Kipsigis . But if they 're speaking English or Kiswahili you would also get the vocabulary for English or Kiswahili . So for somebody who does n't have a native language , they belong somewhere . It is only that they do not know . Not that they do not have , they do not know how to speak it .
Do-do you think there 's a shortcoming in not knowing their native language ?
Mm . Okay , half of the businesses that we conduct-it depends on also where you are . Half of everything that you conduct it 's in English . At least that is eh , accepted formal system . English or Kiswahili . Then those other ones are just an added advantage . Yes . But there is also joy in knowing so many languages . Just imagine me I started- me I know Kipsigis , I know English , I know Kiswahili , I know French . And which other one ? There were five . And maybe a little bit of Chinese . Yea ! You feel like you can grasp things . You are more advantaged then the person who knows fewer languages .
So you feel you are more language reach when you =
Yes , you feel that you have so many ways of expressing yourself . If I lack the English I can use my Kiswahili . If I lack my Kiswahili and I go to a situation whereby I see people are Kalenjin speakers , and I need something from there , I will have to go and speak that Kalenjin . Actually conversational language is supposed to help you attain something , it 's not just " there 's a flower " . Yea , it is for some purpose , to acquire something . Transactional , not just to inform me . So if I need something : " Kona ! Give me ! Nipe ! " Yes , { I 'll have } acquired whatever it is that is needed .
{ How about } Tuseme ya kwamba , wale ambao hawaelewi lugha ya mama , wanaupungufu fulani ,
Yes .
kwasababu kuna jambo ambalo wangelipenda kusema , ama wangelipenda kupata lakini hawana lugha la -I mean- lugha ya : ku-
Kui :
Kuasilisha ujumbe .
Yes . See the way you-Kiswahili is hard . You just- ( she laughs ) you said a sentence in-in Kiswahili and I 'm really trying to answer it . But I 'll miss out on the-those " a " " wa " things , " ki " " wi " things . And " mu " " wa " things , yes . On your question , mm mhh . They are disadvantaged . Wako na upungufu mahari . ( she laughs )
Wanaupungufu fulani ?
Yes .
Naam . Na wewe umesema kwamba una umelisi wa lugha kama takriban tano hivi , umetaja Kifaransa , ukataja Kingereza , ukataja Kipsigis , ukataja pia Kiswahili na Sheng ?
Mm , oh yes .
Umejipata katika : mahali ambapo unachanganya hizi lugha ?
Mm . I mix =
Katika mazungumzo .
Yes . Nime-nimechangaya . You will just allow me to speak in my English ( laughs ) cuz it flows better . Eeh . Na , I have found myself in situations whereby I mix eh , but it depends . I-I 'll mix with friends . I 'll mix the-the : English , Kiswahili , Sheng and any other kind of language . By the way , there 's a language called Franglish , that is French mixed with English .
So Frang ?
Franglish .
Franglish .
Yes .
That 's a new language .
It 's a new language . It 's actually there . The way you can also say Shenglish . Though nobody has come up with that . Perhaps I could come up with it . Yes . See you remember all those things of coining , blending in language . Yea , so it 's been coined or it 's been blended , one of those . Mm hmm .
So that describes a case where you mix { French } and English ?
{ The French } . Yes .
French and English .
And English . So some situations will require that you mix . Even you , you started the conversation with English halafu sijui nini ikakushika katikati ukaanza kwenda Kiswahili that 's like the way I-the same way I 'm using it . You see ? Kiswahili I 'm using it as ... as-I do n't know in what kind of situation but you 've heard the way I 've used my Kiswahili statement , yea . So you mix the same thing with Sheng . You 'll find somebody mwenye anakwambia " eeh , ngori hapa " whatever . Those words are . Yea you 'll somehow mix . Mmm .
You have noted that you normally mix languages maybe in a conversation . Now when are these situations and maybe for what reasons do you mix these languages ?
Umm , what reasons ? Umm :
And maybe in what situations ?
It 's because I can just-I can also use them . Why have it and not use it ? Yea . It 's because I can , that is one of the reasons . Other reasons , it 's umm , to accommodate other people . Yea . If I 'm speaking to a cleaner probably , huyo mwenye ana cleaning hapo hivyo school of arts . Then I just come " Hi , excuse me " And maybe I needed a teacher , and maybe I have seen the teacher come somewhere . Then aah , she 's there cleaning . He or she is there cleaning . Kafanya namuuliza " hey sasa , habari ya asubuhi . Umeona huyo mwalimu kwenye ameingia ? Ameingia ofisi gani ? " Yea , or I can come , " Habari yako ? Have you seen ? " It also depends on , their language . You know the way also somebody is , you can tell if they can be having the knowledge of a certain language English for example . For the workers who are here , at least they know some English . The environment is the one that is allowing them to know some English . So I can mix , the English . And then for you , if I come and find you in an office , I can decide to speak to you both in Kiswahili and English . Just to-yea , just like that . To just-for fun . ( laughs )
Mm mmh . So it 's fun . It 's fun mixing these languages .
Yes . And since you can why not ?
No wonder you talk of Franglish , and-
( laughs ) The Franglish , yes . But though our Franglish , for some of us it 's terrible . Okay , umm , there are people in my class maybe who might know the-the French . So if we are using the Franglish it 's just for fun . Yea . I can " good morning " and mix some French words there . Or I can just say a statement , start in French then reach the parts for the conjugation and I put an English word there . Cuz for the French , the conjugation is really different-difficult . If I say so . So yea , since I came , you mix and since you need to practice sometimes . Yea . And to add flavor . Language is flavorful . When you play with it it 's-it 's- ni tamu .
Kwahivyo kuchanganya ndimi .
Yes .
Ni swag .
Mm , ni swag , yes . Swag .
Okay .
By the way there 's a Kipsigis term for swag .
You should tell me .
Swagate ? ( she laughs heartily )
Now , you talk of mixing languages for fun . Which languages when you mix is fun ? Or which languages do you tend to mix ?
Kiswahili and English are the first ones . French-of late , French and English . French and English , yes . And Sheng and Kiswahili . You know Sheng is not far from Kiswahili most of the words are Kiswahili words so you will tend to mix . And then English and Kiswahili those are two official languages . And then French-French how will I start mixing it with Sheng ? Sheng , first of all the vocabulary might not be so rich , might not be so wide . So English is the other alternative to mix it with .
With French ?
Yes .
Okay . And it 's-{it 's really} =
{ And the Kipsigis it did n't feature anywhere } . The Kipsigis you might mix it with Kiswahili or English , mm .
You have found yourself doing that ?
Yes .. [ says something in different language , presumably Kipsigis ] Or maybe to emphacize something you can mix .
So in situations where you are -want to emphacize something you find yourself mixing . But out of these kinds of mix , or kinds of languages you mix , can you isolate mabye two languages that you , mix most ? Or it 's just-you just equally mix all of them ?
Mm , okay you can n't mix all of them . You-you mix all of them . Okay you can mix you really have that brain eh ? Capacity to accommodate all those . Imagine me starting a statement with " Where .. allez .. going .. ngori " just listen . ( laughs ) You will even miss out on whatever it is that you are saying . Yea . But for : -okay you 've asked the-the languages that I find myself mixing often . Kiswahili and English . English and Kiswahili , these are the accepted systems that we have everywhere . It 's , mmh-okay wacha nisiseme universal but in Kenya , anywhere , that language English and Kiswahili will help you acquire whatever it is that you are seeking or whatever it is that you are doing . So English and Kiswahili , now the most that I mix
I-i-in the way you talk , have you ever noticed any difference from the way the rest of students talk , or speak ?
Mm hmm . Mm hmm . Yea , I could speaking [ ucertain transcription ] or I could be speaking and maybe I do n't have that influence . Or maybe I could be having the influence it depends .
What specificallly-what specifically is the difference between the way you-you talk , { the way} =
{ And somebody else 's }
Other students talk ?
Mmmm , the influence is the first thing that I have said . Mmm . Some might be having the influence from the firs t-t heir first language . So if the person is a Kisii , they will tend to have tha t-t hough not all of them , they will tend to have that influence from Kisii . And then , the vocabulary that you have . Mine might be richer ( she laughs ) but maybe because I read a lot of storybooks and all those things or I read a lot . And somebody else 's could be limited . Maybe considering the kind of vocabulary that they come across everyday . Maybe someone might not be so enthusiastic about learning language . So : the one that you have is the one that they will use to do whatever it is that they are doing . But if I have an interest for example , I find a book somewhere and I just start reading . The word that I might [ uncertain transcription ] that I had not seen it or used it before you might find me using it in the next conversation . yes .
So it 's all about reading , building on vocabulary .
Yes , yes .
Now can you tell if somebody from your area talks . Can you-can you tell that this person comes from my area ?
Yes . I can tell .
How can you tell ?
Mmm , there 's-there 's some specific vocabulary that I might know because of the things that are found in my place .
Even if they spoke in English or Kiswahili ?
Or Kiswahil-no-maybe in mother-yea , maybe in . Because language , you can use it to express whatever it is that you 're seeing . So maybe I have seen aah-what can I say ? If you do n't have a television in your place and I-I-I-I have seen one in my place . I might say ' a television ' and you you 've just-you just know the word . No maybe you do n't even know . For you to use that language you must have-for you to use .. naming . We use language to name things . So me- for me to say a certain kind of [ she speaks in another language ]
Pine .
Hiyo ni pine tree . Yes , in English it 's pine . In Kale eeh , yes . If I have it in my place I would use that kind of vocabulary . I might go to Turkana , where they 've never seen a pine tree . How on earth would somebody start talking about a pinetree and they do n't -they 've never seen it ?
Mm mm .
Yea , so we : -we have vocabulary for whatever it is that is around us . Yes .
So you can tell that this person comes from my area based on the kind of vocabulary they use .
Yes , vocabulary is one of the things .
How else ?
Another thing me is uuh , the way they talk . The-some-sometimes may not be similar . Like aah , let me just use Kipsigis cuz that is the one I know . People from Kericho , people from Sortik and from Transmara . You know the way they use language . People from Transmara , they will have so many vocabularies for things . And very conquenced-conc-ni concentrated . Yea , but somebody from Sortik , their language might be a little bit iko tu hapo hivyo katikati . And somebody from Kericho , their Kipsigis might even be now distorted with the Kiswahili .
Okay .
Yes . So there 's a difference in the way they are going to use the language .
Mm hmm . You have highlighted .. uhh , the way people would use their mother tongue . Okay-uh-it 's-if any other person who does not understand mother tongue .. spoke maybe in English or Kiswahili , could you still pinpoint the area they come from ?
If they have that influence , I can tell where they are coming from . Somebody from Central , an ' l ' in an ' l ' , whether you have it in Kikuyu or in English so they will tend to pronounce it the same way . Especially if they have that kind of influence . So , I will tell . If it 's a Luo and they omit the ' s ' or the ' h ' whichever , you will tell that this is a Luo even if they 're speaking in English . Yes .
Okay . I come from Transmara ( she starts laughing ) . Can you tell that I come from that place from the way I speak ?
( laughing ) From the way you speak , maybe if I interact with you more and know that-and know the kind of vocabulary that you are using is when I will know that you come from those place , eh ?
But so far =
Like for example , what do you call [ she speaks in another language , not Swahili nor Sheng ] . What do you call-you know this-the-the traditional hats [ speaks in another language ] . Unaitaje huko ndani ? Uko ? [ speaks in another language mixed with Swahili . He then responds with ' njoo ' ] ( she laughs ) By the way I learned that wenye nilienda Transmara .
Okay . So it 's the kind of language that people use . It 's the kind of vocabulary .
Mimi since I 've never come across it , mi nitaita [ another language ] . Yea . So you will know . But now for your case , since I have not interacted with you so much , now you will tell me that you come from that place is when I will now start cornering you I 'll say " ah , hii ni Kipsigis ya Transmara " . But had you not said , something that would have helped me is the way you use the language . You might have said something and then I asked you " okay , so what does that mean ? " Yea .
Mm hmm . Even before you-you went ahead and asked or known the kind of vocabulary .. how else ?
How else ? Is there any other way to tell really ?
From the way they talk .
From the way they talk ? Apart from that influence , I-I-I cannot find a reason . Yea maybe there are but I do n't know .
So that if you heard somebody talking and you 've not seen that person , can you also tell their background or the-this-by this I mean the kind , the level of education they 've had =
Yes . I can tell .
Their position in the society .
I can tell . And I will use the same same example here . Influence . Kikuyu : , ah Kisi : . Right now when you are sitting here and somebody down there , huko ni kwa some way , anaongea na ni Mujaluo . And the way they are going to use the language . Tell me you wo n't say that that is a Luo .
How can you tell this maybe ?
You can tell by the way they are speaking . Yea , they have a certain way of speaking . I really cannot pinpoint how but their use of language is not subtly , like somebody-like any other tribe . Them they try to use these bi : g words and then they are influenced also that will come in you will tell . And the way they are pronouncing words .
Also the way they pronounce words .
Pronounciation . Yes . That one .
Okay . How about the level of education ? Does it mean that-okay educated or not these people would pronounce the same words =
The same way . No , no , no , no .
The same way .
No . Somebody who is educated they might aah-try to avoid that influence . They might have learned how to pronounce words properly . So they will use language differently . And then there vocabulary will also be richer than somebody whose-whose not uh-whose not such educated as them . So somebody who is educated you will tend to use language differently . Yes , you cannot expect my granother right now to come and sit and say whatever it is that I 'm trying to explain . Eh ? The same way I 'm explaining it . Yea . She will start meandering and tell you [ says something in another language ] . She will tell you whatever it is that you 'll know , [ uncertain transcription ] for my-for somebody-for my case , an educated person here , you will use language differently from an uneducated person .
Okay , so the organization of language will [ uncertain transcription ] .
Yes .
How about the position in the society ? So that if-if you ever heard somebody talking over the radio , you 've not seen them as such , can you possibly tell the-the-their position in the society ?
Yes you can tell their position . If it 's a : politician they will be giving you examples from the political scene . If it 's a doctor they will be giving you examples from their field . If it 's a teacher he/they 'll be trying to teach you whatever it is they 're-they 're saying . If it 's a : -anybody in their field , you use language the way you know it . If it 's a lawyer for example you know they 'll be using lingua from the law language . Legal language . So you can tell their position in society . Yea .
So that the kind of language they use is shaped =
Yes . By =
To their profession ,
{ By their profession }
{ To their profession }
Yes .
How much they know about that language .
Yea .
How about political affiliation ? Can you tell that somebody is affiliated to this party or that party from the way they-they talk ?
Yes , you can tell . Sadly , hapa Kenya we know that Kikuyus and Kalenjins belong to TLA . ( smile on her face ) And then the : -the Luos and the Luhyas they belong to : -which party is this , O . Yea . But if it-in any other situation , mm ? Let-let me give examples from those other communties , Taita . If I 'm a Taita and we are watching television and I see somebody from a party I 'm affiliated to . Either I 'll speak nicely of them , I 'll even be supporting even if they are in the media for the wrong reasons .
Okay .
Yea , I will tend to support . So you can know the kind of affiliation somebody has by the kind-the way they use the language . The kind of support that they will give the person they are seeing or whatever it is that they 're talking about . They will also more often than not talk about things that happend in the party they 're affiliated to . So I 'll just be giving examples of TNA . We have how many cabinets ooh , whatever , whatever , yea like that so you can tell . You can really tell .
Good .
[ uncertain transcription ]
Do you ever find yourself speaking different languages to different people ?
Mm , yes . I find myself =
Give me when , where and for what reasons .
In school for example . My lecturer . I 'll go and speak to him or her in English . Because it 's a formal language , it 's formalier . There 's no word like that in English by the way ( she laughs ) . But I just had to use it that yea , it 's-it 's more formal =
As compared to what languages ?
As compared to Kipsigis and maybe they do not even understand Kipsigis so how would I start speaking in Kipsigis to somebody who does n't understand . So since it 's a formal situation I will use the English . And then ah-at town , mm ? Mkienda town eh ? To speaking to those people . I know they come from El Doret so somehow someway they have to be speaking Nandi or Kalenjin . So you can speak to them in-not in Kiswahili or Sheng or , yea . Kalenjin . And then , who else can I give- my mother , can speak to her in Kipsigis . [ She speaks in another language . Presumably Kipsigis ]
So however-however much they understand =
Even yea , they understand =
Kiswahili ?
Yes , however much they understand I will somehow find myself speaking to them in Kipsigis .
Do you ever-have you oh-found yourself in a situation in which they speak to you maybe in-in-in Kiswahili or English even if you understand mother tongue ?
Yes . They 've spoken =
In what situations maybe ?
In what situations ? Maybe they 're just feeling like speaking Kiswahili . Or I 'm in a context whereby we have a mixture of so many other people so they know that I 'm in school eh ? In school I use such and such a language . University and primary or high school is different . In high school for example you know we were not allowed to speak any othat language apart from English or Kiswahili . So if it 's my parents speaking to me they will tend to speak to me in those languages . You 'll fit in , you use the kind of language that is being used there , as long as you understand it . Mm .
You =
But they use it and then you 're thinking " Okay , so why did n't you just tell it to me in Kipsigis ? "
So you 're still not comfortable when they-they use that language ?
Mm , not really not comfortable . But there 's that one that we 've always shared .
So-so their use of such language to you is so unusual .
Yes , it is unusual . Especially if you 're not used to talking it ( she laughs )
Okay . You told-you aitted the fact that you can-or you speak differently from other people . Or you 've noticed the difference between the way you talk and the way the other people speak . Have you ever tried to change anything about the way you talk ?
To change the way I talk ?
Yea . And maybe for what reasons ?
Yes , sometimes it requires you to change the way you talk . If it 's ah , your friends for e-my friend for example . There 's no need of me adding color to language , eh ? Trying to show her the kind of vocabulary that I know or I 've amassed . The way I 'm using amassed . I 'm using that because it just came to my mind but you can also practice . But in most cases I 'll find that I just use ordinary language . You do n't care whether even you break the-the formal language . The : -what do you call i t-t he standard kind of language . Like in English there 's that kastandardized form . [ uncertain transcription ] when I 'll be speaking to her , it 's not been much so why add color to the language ? [ uncertain transcription ] for who now ? For Sheng ? Sheng is just keeping growing day in day out . I-I was even left somewhere back in twenty-o-twenty ten ( she laughs ) or tw o-o -nine , so that twenty twelve , twenty thirteen ah- zimenipita . Mm . Maybe just one , two or three . And then um , there 's some situations you need to use language to show the person that you really know to use that language . Yea , my time when ? Eh ? In your case so that I make it difficult for you . ( she laughs ) . But I 'm not going to weng so-sometimes you weng , sometimes you use language to impress . Yea . Sometimes you use language to : -e-with interest if you like the person-if you actually feel like there 's something in common you share with that person . You will tend to improve on your language , you just do n't talk eh ? Like that .
And you ever find-found yourself doing that ?
I do that all the time ( she laughs ) . I weng first of all sometimes-but I think it 's come naturally . It 's come because of the constant use of English . But you know formal situations there 's no way I 'll just start , eh looking for a word like this one here in your paper " what " and then I say " what " . I 'll have to say it in a conventional way , a way that is , yea .
So your use of language , can you say it 's formal , semi-formal ?
Mine , most of the time it 's formal .
Okay .
You 've not noticed that I 've used a lot of English ? ( laughs ) So it 's formal . But in some cases which will require me to be semi-formal .
Why do you think you 're-you 've kept it so formal ?
So formal . I 'm used to English all through . Yea . In primary we were not allowed to talk any other language eh ? Any other language . Just talk English . Only-only Friday . Friday we were allowed to talk Kiswahili starting from hiyo kuimba ya flag , hiyo tunaitaje kwa Kiswahili ? Anthem hiyo . So after singing the anthem how do I just start eh " Tafadhali mwalimu ? " Apart from Kiswahili lessons is when I 'll go and tell the teacher " Habari yako Mwalimu ? Ningependa unifanyie hivi na hivi . " How about for the rest ? And they are tutoring me also in English . How do I come and start telling you " Tafadhali Mwalimu wa Sayansi , ningependa kukuomba kitabu cha " And then I even put that science text book in Kiswahili now . Yea . So .
Ni kwasababu gani mlikuwa mnaambiwa mtumie lugha ya =
Ki-{Kiingereza} ?
{ Kiingereza } na sio Kiswahili ? Ama lugha nyingine .
It was a school that is ah-that has-that was metropolitan . We have Kisiis , we have Luos , we have Taitas , we have all kinds of those . You are hungry . ( she giggles ) We have-we have all those kinds of people so hakuna venye -you will start alienating others . I might talk in-if they allow you-and then they were also trying to promote the-the use of English language . Yea . If you want to talk proper English you keep practicing it . So to avoid aah-all those meanderings and to avoid eh-a case scenario whereby your English will not be so good they tell you to speak in English . So they promote , they try to enrich your vocabulary . By the way we are forced to speak not-let me not say forced . If you are required to speak in English , something that I do not have a vocabulary for , if I do not say-if I do not know how to , it requires for something . Nitafanya bidii nijue kuulizia hiyo kitu kwa English , si ndio . So it will make you learn English more .
Okay . Sawa . The fact that you-you need to use the language will force you to learn the language . Now you talk of more time for English for perfection of English . Do n't you think that in giving more time to English you are killing other languages ?
Not really . Look here , mm ? My Kipsigis is still good despite the fact that I 'm speaking English the whole time . Whatever you have grasped-I know there is this thing that we were told in-in Social Linguistics . [ uncertain transcription ] . There 's a certain age whereby you acquire language . So if I acquired Kipsigis at an earlier age and Kiswahili and English at the same time , it will not disappear . Yea , so there 's no way I will kill those other languages , I just-I 'll just have-(she laughs ) you 're hungry . By the way I 'm seeing a bottle of wine over there , the next time you should be having such interviews there should be tea . So there 's no way you will kill those other languages . There 's a certain age to where you will know the language . You will acquire the vocabulary for the language . So those other years it will just be adding the vocabulary . How there is the main stream eh ? How to construct a sentence and MAJOR things that have been around you , the naming , zakuname , za kurequest , za kuinquire , you 'll know them . So how else will you be killing it ? Or maybe you are killing Kiswahili on the other hand . Look now my Kiswahili is lame , then English because I 've been using English more . But I do n't know why for the mother tongue it is still good . I 'll still know it . Yea . So =
So your { Kiswahili } has been affected by =
{ And then } .
Your use of English .
Yes my Kiswahili has been affected by my use of English .
But not your mother tongue .
But not my mother tongue . And then Kiswahili is funny . It 's been changing . Like you-when you were learning probably there 's this- zilikuwa zinaitwaje ? Iya , awa , muwa , kivi ?
Ngeli .
Ngeli ! Ngeli zimeshinda zikibadilika . In my case it was " muwa " -no , in your case it was " muwa " . In my case I came to a point whereby they were telling me it 's " awa " . So you see it 's been changing . The structure , the systems , they 've been improving it . I do n't know if it 's improving it or just making alterations here and there . But for Kipsigis , " kongoi " has remained " kongoi " . There 's no additions to it . Yea .
And English ?
English ehh ? There are additions to it . There are alterations to it . But since we 've been using it all along and we are always constantly using it we will keep up with the trend .
Good . And quite interesting . Now , let 's-let 's talk about you and your friends nowadays . What would you normally talk about ?
What we talk about ? The [ uncertain transcription ] , like-okay it depends on the kind of friend-friends . As for me I divide my friends into categories . There are those primary friends . Primary friends not primary ile ya primary shule . Primary the term , primary itself means something that is closer , first . So my primary friends are those who are close to me . My secondary friends are those one who are friends of my friends . See these my friends now they might be having friends . So I can know those other people through them . Those would be my secondary friends . Then these secondary friends they might be having their friends . I 'll call them tertiary friends . And I am sure everyone else does that only that maybe they do n't know the term to divide their friends into . So my primary friends we 'll talk about everything . Not , of course , the weather . The weather is borin-a boring subject .
For your close friends .
Yea , for my close friends . And then , under those close friends it depends . If it 's male we 'll talk about something different . If it 's women , we will talk about men , boys , mm . Yes .
But you do n't talk-you do n't talk about boys when you 're with men ?
Do I talk about boys when I 'm with men ? It depends if I 'm with the boys or I 'm with men . You know boys haimaanishi you are young . They are men who still behave like boys and I 'll just call you a boy cuz you 're behaving like a boy ( she laughs ) . Haitegemei age . Yea , there are people who are twenty seven and they 're behaving like they just turned nineteen . How will you expect me to =
You mean-okay in how they talk ?
Maturity yea . The level of maturity . Whatever even they will say . There are some things I will just not accept you to tell me . Or you might tell me and I 'm thinking " Mm , did you really think well before you told me that ? " Yea . And for my closest friend , mm ? We talk about everything now . Everything .
And you mean everything .
And I mean everything . ( she laughs )
What in this case-
Is everything ?
Is everything ?
Mm . It could be men , classwork , mm ? Life , job , work , your situations , the future . Yea . Or even hair . Hairstyles . Beauty , yes . Fashion . I love fashion by the way . ( she laughs ) And I love beauty stuff so I 'll find myself once in a while talking about it . But you will not find me talking-but sometimes I do have etu-educational topics . I 'll almost said " etucational " . Yea , but you will not find me talking I do n't know-these scores ' analysis . This =
When you 're with friends .
Yea .
I mean your close-your close friends .
Yea . Mm . So we talk about everything ranging from nothing to everything .
Okay . How about your-your talked about secondary friends ?
Tertiary friends . ( smiling ) And where do you place yourself by the way on this list , are you my friend first of all ?
You have the answer ( he laughs )
I do n't know .
I do n't need to =
I do n't need to ?
I 've yet to find out .
You 're yet to find out ? Now these secondary friends we do n’t share . You know , communication also it depends on , em , frequency with which you talk with somebody . If we talk more often , we 'll have more often things-we 'll-we 'll more often have things to talk about . If we talk once a week-I meet you next week so I 'll just greet you and probably talk about a boring subject like the weather .
Okay .
Yea , something we can share in common . Cuz you might not know what I-I 've experienced the past week I might not have told you this . I might not have told you what I do . You will have no idea what I do . So we just talk about boring subjects like " Ah , it 's raining and it 's been raining ! " And then you expa : nd that topic .
And-and what 's the danger of-of um talking the same topic that you talk with your close friends with your secondary friends ?
What is the danger ? There might go and tell it out . How do I just start telling you about my personal when I-we 've not been talking . Yea it does n't happen . It does n't occur to me . Mm . So I just cannot start telling them " So this happened to me " and maybe that time I 'm even sobbing or [ uncertain transcription ] . Yea . So you do n't tell everybody everything .
Your tertiary friends .
( laughs ) My tertiary friends . Oh by the way if I am talking too much just tell me to kind of do this ( she laughs ) . Am I ?
Your tertiary friends .
Mm , tertiary . That list is long , mm hmm .
{ And I guess } I fall there .
{ Those ones } You fall there ?
I am not so sure . You-you are yet to tell me before the end of this interview .
Eh , this-eeh-discussion . Where do you want to place yourself ?
The kitchen cabinet .
( She laughs ) Which is ?
( pause before response ) Your closest friend .
Then if you want to come there then work towards it .
That means I am not there already ?
You are not there . ( both laugh ) But was this sort of eh ? Yea , maybe I 'm just saying it to =
Talk about your tertiary friends please .
My tertiary friends . They are friends of friends of friends . Mm ? Those ones-oh God- hiyo sasa itakuwa tu salamu once in a while or you just pass them also .
Mm hmm . So =
Ila tu once in a while . Maybe : we come from the same university and I 've seen you somewhere in Kericho . So I 'll tend to say hi . And start-start talking things about MOI University cuz we 've once shared that . But if we 're here within campus , [ uncertain transcription ] we might even just wave and never say anything or just " Hi ! " . Hata inakuwa ya kufakisha ( to fake it ) . It might be " Hi ! " and you just smile and maybe you 're { even moody} =
{ You 're on a move . }
That day , yea . Mm . So those are the tertiary friends . There 's really nothing much to share about . And then , in life were we talking about life stories here ? Mm . In life you do n't aah-you do n't have a-you do n't have so many friend . Okay it 's good to have many friends but no t-t hey will-they will also eat your time , mm . Because I believe in-in really investing in friendship . So if you 're my friend I will make sure that I invest in that kind of friendship . Ile tu it 's transparent and mutual kind of friendship . And then , those other friends , those many , many friends I may not have time for you and as a friend I do n't even know if you 'll still call me a friend . So if you have a few within your circle , then within the outer circle you can now have those many people whom they will not care . These ones outside the circle , mm , unataka kuniambia nikigonjeka they will come and bring me porridge and fruits or whatever huko kwa dispensary ? No , it 's just those close friends .
Now , the point was what do we-do you talk about with these close friends maybe ?
Mm . What do we talk about ? Eeh , I said from nothing to everything . Ranging from nothing to everything . Somethings you can just be with your friend and you know there are those coded words or languages or something you 've-when you 'll tend to stay with somebody longer you 'll tend to have-find humor in the same kind of things . So she or he might see something funny and I also see it . And we laugh . See , we did n't talk about anything but we-the fact that we 've seen that , we laugh . So we would communicated there . So that is nothing to me . Then from-to everything . Now those are the things even the bulbs , even te-something we see on television , a class that you 've just had , lecturers , people like you we also talk about people like you . Yea , even clothes fashion everything .
You mean-when you talk about people like me you mean men ?
Yes ( both laugh ) . I mean men yes .
Okay . Interesting . .
Oh God .
I should know what you talk about . Especially when you talk about men . What do you normally talk about ?
What do we talk about ? Oh God . We are now getting personal in this kind of interview . When we talk about eeh-men . If they are good looking or not . Or if they are good looking-they are not good looking and they have other skills . By the way naku -let me now tell you heh , on a personal point of view cuz I see we are headed there . Mm , what somebody has to offer me is what I will see . Okay sometimes you look at the physical but there are-there 's more to that . Huwezi ukakula sura ( she laughs ) . They say that or rather I say that . So sometimes somebody is just intelligent and you could be liking that aspect of him . Intelligence in the person . Sometimes somebody could just be modest , see ? Generous and I do not mean generous in that they give out handouts . They are generous in whatever it is . Somebody can just be known , they have a good heart . They are good . Or rather they can have a straight conversation . You know they are people you can sit with them and you have nothing to talk about so why would you entertain that . So yea . Those ones .
That 's what you talk about .
Mm .
That 's great .
Mm hmm . More questions ? ( she laughs )
What do you want to ask me maybe ?
Although what I want to ask you ? We are still recording ? ( she laughs )
Just ask .
I ask you a question ?
What can you , ask about ?
Now , those questions that you were asking me , the one-especially " What do you normally talk about with your friends ? " I will not ask you that kind of language you are using but what do you normally talk about with your friends ?
My friends depending on the kind of friends . We talk about life issues , we talk about academics , financial management , and all that .
Financial management , interesting . Mm . You even categorized it . Maybe I also talk about it but I 've never put it in the category of financial management so that 's a new aspect to learn . Mm .
So , it 's been very nice and-it has been nice talking to you . Be sure that the kind of information you have given to me will go a long way to meet the objectives of this =
Study .
Study . Research . Thanks so much .
You 're welcome .
