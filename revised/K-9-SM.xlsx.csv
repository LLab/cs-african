,,Alvin,00:10:00mins,"Mmm, I think it's-it's  important to learn more than even English.  Because now BA Kiswahili we've got those who take linguistics,<Swahili label='elaboration'>lugha raisimu</Swahili label='elaboration'>.  There are those who take literature, that is <Swahili label='elaboration'>fasihi</Swahili label='elaboration'>.  And there are those who take <Swahili label='high expertise'>utafsiri na ufasiri</Swahili label='high expertise'>, that is translation and interpretation.  So I do take translation.  So if you're in the translation, for you to be competent when translating text, you have to at least know some, be competent in at least two languages. Cause you don't restrict yourself  you, that you're only a Swahili student so you should only restrict yourself to Kiswahili.  Aaah, and I think it's even important to know even a fourth language if possible cause I know my vernacular mother-tongue Luo, I'm supposed to know Swahili fairly well, again I know English fairly well, and then I'm supposed to know my third language which I'm-aah I'm supposed to be-I had started learning my French.  Because if maybe you find somebody, maybe a transnational, maybe an NGO, maybe contracts you to translate maybe a text or a book. So you know if you only know maybe two languages, it could be maybe you limit your opportunities.  You narrow them down to only that.  But if you know maybe French, you can translate from French to English, Swahili, you can even end up translating it to your vernacular.

OLF: Alvin is in two instances using Swahili to elaborate what he has said in English. At the same time and more evident in the third instance he specifically uses the Swahili word, thinking that perhaps the interview would not know what the words mean.

You have to go there and explain it in Swahili cuz the research you've done, the project is all about Swahili. So it will be very irrelevant I'm there with English and the research is all about Swahili.  So the context will determine the type of language we use, it varies.  I can't say that I want to use English in all of them.  I'm talking to: like my friend we discussing about soccer it's English. I'm with my coursemates it's English.
