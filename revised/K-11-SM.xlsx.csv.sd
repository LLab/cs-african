So thank you for making time , to : -for this conversation about your .. language use .
Thank you too .
Yea . So you 're welcome and uuh , we 'll start with , we have a few questions that we 'll go through , okay , and feel free to use any language you feel like using . And then eh .. yea-just say anything . It does n't have to be answering the question , yea , specifically . You have anything you want to add , just-it 's a discussion . Yea .
Yea .
So let 's start by : - I want to know , what language do you use , with your family ?
Eeh : when it comes to my family ,
Yea .
It depends o-o kay , I have a weird family set up . My { mother} =
{ Weird ? Mm hm ? }
is a Kikuyu .
Yes .
My father is a Meru .
Mm hmm .
And uh , they both do n't like Kiswahili , which is my favorite language .
Mm hmm .
So : =
So how do they communicate themselves ? Between =
The : y =
Or is it-is Meru and Kikuyu related ?
Yea , if you hear Kikuyu , you do n't find it hard to understand Kimeru plus they have lived at-uuh the various places where Kimeru is spoken and Kikuyu is spoken . And I live in Nanyuki where Kikuyu is dominant . So : they can speak in Kikuyu . But since we were young , there 's a-okay I was born in-I was born in Nanyuki then brought up in Meru for some-quite some time , so when I was there I could n't speak in English or Kiswahili . So when we shifted in Nanyuki , you know now in school answering the questions , talking to other-uh , the neighbor 's kids , it was a problem . So since-since then , there was a rule that if you want to be heard you should either speak in Kiswahili or English .
Mmm , { so is a-it was rule ? } ( light laughter )
{ So :} Yes . So now f : or my siblings and I we-we can use English or Kiswahili from that point , up to date .
Mm hmm . But you-you also speak Kikuyu { and you also speak Kimeru }
{ Yes , I can speak Kikuyu and I can speak Kimeru } yes . But it comes automatically we : -uh converse in English or Kiswahili . Whereby my parents if you do n't use Kikuyu or Kimeru you 'd rather use English . They do n't { use Kiswahili } .
{ Not Kiswahili }
Yes .
Is it because Kiswahili is more difficult { do you think} ?
{ They :} talk of it being so hard , " Kiswahili ni ngumu " . And you know following all those ah- kaida za lugha ya Kiswahili becomes tough on them . Yea .
Mm hmm . How about-with your friends at home , which-which eh language do you use ? Or languages ?
With uh , my friends , sometimes you mix Kiswahili Kizungu hapa na pale . And uh then there are those who stick uh , to English Kiswahili has no funds as such . So I find myself mixing Kiswahili and English and uh =
Or just English .
Or just English , and some Sheng here and there .
Kikuyu no , not at all ? { With your } friends at home ?
{ Kikuyu } , if you can speak Kikuyu { then we can speak}-
{ Because you said } Nanyuki is Kikuyu =
Dominantly . Yes .
Soo , you sometimes you also speak { Kikuyu to your friends ? }
{ Yes sometimes I also-}which is uh , rare .
{ Rare ? }
{ People-}people hardly use vernacular =
Why ? Because-is it that they feel " ai , this one is too : , I 'm too local . Or ah-what-what is it ? ( she is giggling in the background )
And uh : then there 's this notion Nanyuki is a : interacial , interlingual town , so even when you speak your mother tongue not only Kikuyu , it feels like you 're being too tribalistic .
Okay . ( he yawns )
People avoid the languages .
You do n't want to be seen as being a tribal kind of person ?
Yes .
What happens when it comes to school ? When you are now in school ? Here in campus ?
When I 'm ah , here in campus ,
Yes , which languages do you use ?
Let me : divide my friends into two . There are my classmates who are my friends . Aah , for those ones we use pure Swahili .
Pure Swahili .
Yea , because they are my classmates we are { Kiswahili majors-}
{ Oh you are Swahili majors }
Yes . So those ones if I meet you on the way it comes automatically ,
Not just in class ? Even =
Even in class when I come to see you in your room we feel =
Ah you feel =
Naturally Kiswahili .
Even if one of them or two of them is a Kikuyu ?
Yes , even if one is a Kikuyu or a Meru which I can speak ,
Yea .
We : -we all understand English . But you will find that when it 's um , my classmates , it becomes Kiswahili .
Is this a rule that you made or is it just-
No , we : it 's exciting plus not very many people use Kiswahili , and if they use Kiswahili =
So this is also something of , { Swahili [ uncertain transcription]}-
{ Identification yes-}
A grouping that you want to-to show , or you want to lock out these others who do n't=
No , we do n’t lock out-you know everyone has lifted up English and other foreign languages up there so that Kiswahili has { no space }
{ So you feel that its ' your mission as Swahili messa-majors to-to :
Yes . Yes .
Ah okay , so I think that 's a good thing .
So , if it 's my classmates no-
What do others say about that ? [ uncertain transcription ]
No they just gaze like-I 'm from doing a presentation . And it happened that my twelve member group .. um , constituted of Swahili majors and-you know people cock , silent " let 's listen to them . Waswahili , wataalamu wa lugha wa sanii " =
Eeh , and you were actually presenting in Kiswahili ?
Yes everything . From introduction to your identification is in Kiswahili .
Mmm hmm .
So when it comes to my classmates , we use Kiswahili . It 's not a rule . We did n't actually sit down one day and decide-it
It just comes just like that , it 's like =
Even when you meet other years like first years =
Who are also Kiswahili majors ?
Yea , you speak Kiswahili . It comes-from the greetings =
So it 's a departmental thing ?
Yes , { I could say that }
{ A Swahili department thing } . Mmm .
But ah , when it comes to my other friends , you can uh , use Kiswahili definitely a lighter version of it ,
Yea .
I can use English or , you can mix the two .
A lighter version of Kiswahili ? What do yo mean by a lighter version of Kiswahili ?
( She laughs ) You know there 's a Kiswahili I can speak- ah , kile ni-ambacho ni cha kitaaluma . And we might-I might be locking you out or I might end up explaining everything .
Kiswahili sanifu .
Yes .
Mmm . Kiswahili cha =
Na msamiati na istilahi muafaka .
Mm hmm , you are now almost losing me . [ she laughs ] Um : how about-I mean-Kiswahili you have really talked about Kiswahili in a passionate way ,
Yes .
You have a special thing eh ? About Kiswahili .
Yea .
How about English ? Is English important for you to know ?
English is uh , very important . Especially in Kenya where , it has it 's-a major role as a-a language . And uh , there are people who cannot-who are not from my vernacular group . And they do n't understand Kiswahili so I will need the English . And then uh , I 'll also need the English when it comes to traveling to areas where Kiswahili and my vernacular languages are not used .
Then I assume Kiswahili , even if it 's not that sanifu that you said , if it is this one ya kawaida or this one , what did you call it ?
The : lighter { version of Kiswahili }
{ The lighter version of Kiswahili } I think almost everybody in Kenya would understand that . { So why would you want to use English ? }
{ Or in : -uh : -governmen-}you see , like uh , in so many offices . Especially in government offices cuz I have an experience with it . Or even here in campus . There 's an office you 'll go and introduce yourself in Kiswahili and the person serving you will just look at you as in " can you speak a language I 'm understanding ? " ( they both laugh )
So the people claim they speak Kiswahili ?
They claim =
When they list the languages they say " { Kiswahili} =
{ Kiswahili and English }
Mother tongue and English .
Yea . But I once took my registration form for the courses and I spoke in Kiswahili . " Naomba , uh .. fomu yangu ya usajili wa kozi iidhenishe . "
Essh !
And the secretary just looked at you =
( laughs ) Looked at you and wondered what-what are you talking about ?
If I did n't switch to English I would n't have been served .
So at that moment you switched to English immediately ?
Definitely . Immediately . Yes .
Yea . Okay . What if you-that secretary was a person you shared a mother tongue like Kikuyu ? For example or Kimeru ? Would you ah , have switched to Kimeru ?
Personally-ok as a person , I do n't use ah , my vernacular language in ah , offices . Especially =
In an office set up .
Yea , in an office set up . But if I meet the same person on a lighter note and maybe it 's some joke we are talking . As in =
Or in the cafeteria ?
Yea , we can .. talk .
You can do that .
Yes .
Mmm , you can ask for the salt for example in-in Kikuyu ?
Because you might end up coming after me in that office and you are not served . You might go having the feeling that " I- kama ningezungumza Kimeru or Kikuyu , huenda ningehudumiwa " . Yea .
So you are convinced that English is important , as much as your Kiswahili is also important .
Important . Yes .
How about the mother tongues ? For you it 's two-{two native languages . }
{ For me there are two } of which I speak fluently and others that I can hear . { I can} =
{ Is it } important for anyone to know ? { a mother tongue} ?
{ It 's important , } to : know your mother tongue . For example , I use this example of ah , the grandparents . When ah you go for this family get togethers , most of the times we have been blamed-we the university students that even we who are Kiswahili majors , when you go to the rural areas , you cling so much onto English that they dont ' understand . So : sometimes the vernacular helps in communication with the illiterate , those who cannot understand English as much as they are learned , and uh , also in cases of research . Like aah , I 'm doing a proposal on a- nyimbo za taarab katika utamaduni wa-Waswahili . In some communities if you do not identify by the language they speak they might end up denying you so much details that you need . So : =
So you want-you-when you go there you want to use-
Wha t-t he { language they use}-
{ But then that would mean } if you are doing it .. in central province , or in Nanyuki , okay , that you can do . But if you are doing it in coast , how is your mother tongue important ?
It 's not that important in such a case but , you 'll find that if I ’m taking a research in a Kikuyu based ah , community where I can speak Kikuyu , I will end up getting more details and the people I am using in my research will be more free and open to I who can speak their language , to another person who cannot even share the greetings in their language . Yes .
So if you had to rank the languages that you know in importance-{which one is the most important-}
{ in uh , the vernaculars ? }
No . No =
In { all the languages that I speak ? }
{ The vernacular } , the-the Kiswahili and the English ?
I would rank Kiswahili first . Then English . And then Kikuyu is more widely spread then Kimeru . Yea . Those ones I can speak fluently .
What is the criteria you are using to rank because , I thought Kiswahili is important in certain =
Areas .
Areas and context . English is also important in certain areas . And mother tongue is also impor-why do n't you just say all of them are same rank ?
They-actually in Kiswahili we say " no language is better than another language " . Even the :
But you have just said-told me that Kiswahili-
I have just ranked them ( while laughing )
Is the best . Is it because , mm hmm
I use the : -criteria of ah- if I were called in a particular area , and I was to be useful , basing myself on the languages . I would be very much productive on Kiswahili followed by English , { Kikuyu , ) then Kimeru .
{ So you would ? } Mm ? You would be more productive in Mombasa ? Then in-in-in Nyeri ?
Yes .
I think those Nyeri people will lead-need you more ( she laughs ) . Especially if you are going to-to do what , to teach Kiswahili .
To teach Kiswahili in a-if I were to teach Kiswahili in Nyeri for example , there 's this notion that a teacher can use her mothertongue to drive a point home . If I combine the two definitely my productivity rises . Because I can teach you in Kiswahili nikwambie " hii ni meza " and then in Kikuyu nikwambie = - "
Give more explanations in Kikuyu .
Yes
Oh . So do you-do you sometimes mix these languages , in the same conversation ? Or do you always do that ?
Sometimes I-
You mix them , do you mix them ?
Yes I do mix .
In one conversation ?
Yes .
Mm hmm . Most of the time or-
Mmm , apart from inofficial contexts , most of the time I do mix English and Kiswahili .
When-when for example ?
Like , when we are just telling stories , with my friends . On a phone call , apart from when it 's=
Phone call ? Even when you are calling your dad ?
Yes . For my dad . No my dad I use English . Because he does n't like ah Kiswahili ,
So you do n't mix ?
I do n't mix when I 'm talking to him .
When you are on the phone , uh with eh … who now ... somebody who is senior to you . Maybe you are calling your professor .
That one I dare not .
You dare not mix .
Yes . ( they both laugh )
How about with the : fellow friends , students ?
Now that one comes in .
You mix .
The mixing .
Why-why is that the case ? Why-why mix when it is this person and not-
And not-you see like , if I ’m calling my lecturer , it comes , psychologically and automatically this is a-an English , a lecturer . Like I take television journalism . So when it comes to communicationing with that lecturer , it 's English . Then when it comes to my lecturers like my Kiswahili lecturers I speak Kiswahili that after the call I 'd wonder " was that you ? " but there 's no instance of { mixing the two } .
{ Mixing the two } . Mmm . So this mixing is something that is con-you do consciously .
Yes .
When you know and you know that this one is-{Or is it-or is it natural that sometimes you have to-}
{ Although sometimes it comes automatically } you do n't get to know in that statement I actually spoke { three languages in one }
{ And then you-you correct yourself } very quickly if it 's your lecturer and-is it-is that-does that happen ?
Yes . If you happen to mix-like in Kiswahili if you 're trying to : refer to something , whose name in Kiswahili you do n't know , once you remember it , you know sometimes you forget you 're trying " ah , phone , phone , phone what is a phone in Kiswahili ? " you can end up saying " a phone " . And then when you remember you correct yourself kwamba ni simu . Ndiyo .
Mm hmm . What languages do you mix often ?
Aah , English and Kiswahili .
Mm hmm , which other languages do you mix-are there any other languages you mix ? [ uncertain transcription ] English and Kiswahili ? In one conversation ?
When it comes to : -English and Kiswahili in one . And then Kimeru and Kikuyu in one . But =
You also mix Kimeru na-
And Kikuyu yes .
Why would you do that ?
Because eh , sometimes you will know some-something in Kikuyu and { you do n't know in Kimeru} =
{ Would you be speaking } to a Kikuyu speaker or a Meru speaker ?
Any of them and then if you 're the Kikuyu speaker , that I ’m speaking to , and I end up mentioning something in Kimeru you 'll correct me . ( he yawns)Or =
And then you 'll say " no , you do n't say it that way " , it 's that person who says that .
Yea . Like I learnt Kikuyu later than Kimeru . So sometimes I 'm speaking in Kikuyu =
Without knowing ?
No , as in-when I came to Nanyuki I already knew Kimeru but I did n’t know Kikuyu . And then after interacting with Kikuyus I learnt the Kikuyu language . But in the earlier stages , I could still mix like-tell you something " give me that .. phone " . Now I ’m speaking in Kikuyu and then I ask for it in Kimeru unknowingly and then you correct me .
Na kunatofauti with the way you speak , with the : other-other : the way you talk with the other students ? Have you noticed ? Tofauti yeyote between the way you talk and the way they talk ?
The difference between the way I talk and the way { other students talk} ?
{ Other students talk } ehn . Is there-have you noticed if there is a difference ?
A sss-very slight one . Uuh , depending on whether I 'm using Kiswahili . Like uh , when it 's my classmates you know we use the Kiswahili Sanifu , maybe there 's some vocabularies we heard a lecturer use and it 's a new word that you are using and others do n't know . So when others use ah , Kiswahili it might not be correct . It might not ah , be the Kiswahili sanifu so that can make the slight difference , but , yes .
Mmm , that is with , other students ?
Yes .
Okay , but with students of Kiswahili majors , is there any difference ?
Yea , like the : accents . You could be speaking the same Kiswahili referring to the same thing but the way you drive it home , is different .
Does Kiswahili have different accents ? Za tofauti ?
The : lahaja ?
Lahaja ?
No .
Lahaja tofauti , ama ni-ama ni , kuna ?
Ndiyo . Kuna lahaja ya Kiunguja , Ki[uncertain transcription ] , Kipemba ,
Yea , kunazo lakini labda namaanisha kati yenu nyinyi . Because you come from different-you do n't even come from those which has [ uncertain transcription ]
Different places .
So kunatofauti ? Ya lahaja ?
Hapana .
No . But then , why are you saying that is a difference ?
There 's a way I can speak to imply the coasterian accent . We sometimes do that . Or I can just speak kile Kiswahili cha darasani ama naweza nikazungumza kile Kiswahili tu cha =
So it 's possible for you to adjust and speak , change the way you speak your Kiswahili for different people and different occasions .
Yea , if uuh , you introduce yourself to me as a Swahili I 'll switch . The same Kiswahili but the rising and the falling of my words will change .
Mmm , the tone .
Yes .
Mm hmm . And is it , is it possible for you to tell that huyu mtu anatoka a certain area just from the way they talk ?
Some : times yes , sometimes no .
Tell me about those times that it is possible to tell ? What-or how do you-how can you tell ? That this person , huyu " ai ! Huyu ni wa Rift Valley . Na huyo , { huyo ni wa central } ? "
{ Ni wa Central } There 's aah , the accent . That is a : major part of =
When you say accent what do you mean ?
The : the way you pronounce some words .
What would a Kikuyu do , that a-that a-a Rift Valley person would not do ?
Like uh , there are these words that are associated with the people from the Rift Valley . Like when Rudisha says fiatu fyangu that is Kiswahili but you can tell where he comes from .
( amusement in his voice ) So you are talking about influence fro-by the mother tongue ?
Yes .
Mm mmh .
If it 's a : Kikuyu from the same fiatu fyangu , angesema kwa mfano " viatu vyagu . "
Viatu vyagu ?
Ndio .
Mm hmm .
You can tell it 's-where they come from .
Mm hmm . How a-how about anything else apart from that influence of mother tongue ? Is it possible to tell ?
No , that is what like stands out more than anything else here .
Is there not a dif-there-is there no difference .. in choice of words that people from this region choose certain words ?
Yea .
Mm . Is there such a thing ?
There 's uh , that-let me call it a stereotype . That ah , for example the -those from Nyanza , if you hear them talk these big big like if it 's money , they talk of millions and checks-
( laughs ) They talk in terms of exxageration : and =
Yes , if it it 's a car it has to be the supermodel , yea .
So that if a person talks that way , you 'll know that this is a Luo .
You 'll know it 's a Luo , yes . And if ah-
And a Kikuyu-what , how do they do it ?
Kikuyus have been stereotyped to be business oriented even in areas where no other person { would have thought of . }
{ So most of the } msamiatis ni zile { za pesa }
{ Za pesa } na kazi . Eeh .
Mmh .
If it 's a : -when it comes to food , they 're very choosy on their chickens , you 'll tell that 's a Luya .
( laughs ) How about eh , the person from Rift Valley , Kalenjin ?
Aah , apart from the : -
Accent .
The accent ... no I 'm not sure about those from the rift valley .
But you ' ve interacted with them , I think =
Here in ah , school .
Here in school . Nanyuki they are not there ?
No .
No . Okay . Here in school =
No , they are there very few . { Unless} =
{ So } maybe it 's a short while that you 've interacted with them , you 've not been able to tell that .
Yes .
And is it still possible like to tell the background of somebody , even if you can n't see them ? But you list-you are just listening =
Listening =
To-to talking .
Yes , like ah , the example we have just given on the Luos . If a person is in a different room on a phonecall or just talking . Like eh , " can you send my driver . And I do n't want the Toyota I want the Mercedes this time round " . You can tell where that =
Mm hmm . And they usually would be loud so that the people hear .
Definitely . Yea . Or I am sorry I forgot to sign the ten million check I was suppposed to sign .
( laughs ) Yea . So that one would be a Luo .
Yes , that would be a Luo .
And it 's the same also for a Kikuyu discussing issues to do with mbesha ?
Yes .
How about things like eh : level of education of somebody ? Can you tell , without seeing them ? They 're just talking ? Can you tell that this person reached a certain level of education ? Or … is it possible ?
So , not really a : a likely to happen . And even if you tell the level of education I might not be able to tell you " these are class two- "
Not specifically , I 'm just saying-primary level for example . Compared to somebody in secondary level or univeristy level . Is it possible ?
Yea , like uh , if there are three students , one a university student in campus , they-there 's ah things that will stand out in a conversation with such a person .
Mmm .
Like uh , talk of ah , lectures . Ah , these courses , the exam cards , you know the vocabulary . If it 's a person in ah , high school , the funkees stand out . The going outs of the symposiums , the functions that they go , { the sports }
{ The funkees are functions ? }
Yes . It 's-they really enjoy those opportunities to go out of school so they will always talk " eh , na hiyo funkee ilikuaje ? " " Ah , hiyo shule … " =
Did you used to enjoy yourself ?
Yes .
You did . You went for those funkees .
Yes .
But you-did n't you- do n’t you enjoy them now ?
Here when I =
Or it 's not so much of a big deal ?
Not so much of-you know the socializing part of it is at it 's peak in high school .
In high school .
So that if you 're making a list of the schools to come , boy 's school have to be more if the school inviting them is a girls ' school .
Aah , okay . Are n't you-are you one of the people organizing these things ? ( laughter ) You must have been .
I happen to have been a prefect so , { I did organize } some .
{ So you were involved }
And for some of them we were organzied by the principle and the deputy . Like they used to like the : Kenya High girls interacting with the Alliance Boys . { So if you 're making a list} =
{ So you 're from Kenya High} ? You were in Kenya High ?
Yes . So if you 're making a list , make sure Alliance is there and Starehe , that one the principle will sign .
Mm mmh . Aah , okay but if you write these other funny , funny : =
Schools . They might end up not signing .
Not signing for those . They want you to : { interact with the }
Interact { with the bigger } people then we were .
Ok . Yes . How about something like somebody 's position in the society ?
Yea , just like ah , education , a person could be speaking of ah : my servants , my secretary , and uh , that one is only available for the big =
What if you have a common topic ?
Eh he ?
Tha t-t hat this manager is talking about ? And eh , this eh : cleaner , eh ? Of the same organization is talking about . You give them the same topic , to discuss . Can you tell the dif-that this one is- …
Yes . Like =
Just a normal topic , { about for example } your typical day or something like what ? The best day you have had ? Is it possible to tell ?
{ Yes , let 's say its aah}Yes , if it 's abou t-t his is a manager , and a cleaner . If a cleaner was to speak about their best day in life-this is a low income , hana . They could be speaking of , the way they bought-
Okay , forget abou t-t hat one is easy . Let 's just say a topic .. or we give them a verse to read from the bible , both of them . Can you tell ?
From the way they read ?
Yea .
Mm , it depends with the verse .
Mm .
Like uh , this one for the poor man and the rich man , this Lazarus . The way they-the verse-the same verse will have an impact on them , differently . So if the : the rich-this manager is to read and see that the rich man in the bible ended up in hell , he will not be enthusiastic or he will not be excited about the verse . But for the cleaner , ha-he-he has some hope . He knows he has a future ah , place that he 's heading to .
Let 's look at it in another way , you have two people speaking about politics . And they do n't mention that I am jubilee and you are O , can you tell from the way they-they are talking that this is Jubilee-this one must be Jubilee and this other one-without mention-they do n't mention their party .
Yes .
Is it possible ?
In some cases it is .
Mm hmm . Yea , how ?
Like during the campaigns for example , you : could talk of their manifestos for example . Like I can n't wait for those laptops . I can n't wait for this and this ah , to happen . Or in the CHORD , for example you can talk of " eh hii ni time ya Waagwambu " . Yea . You have not mentioned , but I can tell , huyu ni wa CHORD . Huyu ni wa Jubilee .
So you : you said you speak around four languages ? Is it four or five ?
Four .
Four . So do you speak these different languages to different people ?
Definitely . Yes I do .
Give me examples again . I know probably you have mentioned this but you can just tell me again .
If uh , when it comes to English , I use English with uh- especially on official business , I can use it with my lecturers apart from my Kiswahili ones . In aah , o-o - governmental offices because Kiswahili has been discouraged enough times . I can also use it aah , when speaking { to my parents } .
{ Which you are not happy about ? }
Yes . Definiteley . Then when it comes to Kiswahili I use Kiswahili mostly when talking to my classmates , lectureres , um ... ya . ( interviewer yawns )
Kiswahili lecturers .
Kiswahii lectureres . Yes . Aah , mother tongue I can use it with my friends at home or - in a lighter note like the way you had mentioned on aah , asking for salt in a cafeteria I can use that one . Sometimes you just want to remind yourself about home and " eh , you 're a Meru ? " we switch .
So these languages have different targets in everyday life .
Yes .
Why is that , the case ?
Apart from the fact that-you see sometimes it 's not everyone who will understand the Kikuyu I 'm speaking .
Mm hmm .
That one rules out the Kikuyu in a certain , ah , topic . Ehh , same case with =
What if we are talking about people who understand ?
Aah , Kikuyu ?
No . Well-ok let 's say , people will under-let 's say Kiswahili because everybody does understand .
Does understand Kiswahili . I : have mentioned where it 's discouraged . Even when it 's a-a-approved on writing that " Kiswahili is accepted in this office " . And when you speak the Kiswahili It 's not very much appreciated . So that one , pushed-pushes you to speaking in-in English . Yea .
You told me that you can , change your Kiswahili ?
Yes .
And speak to a certain person in a different Kiswahili . Have you ever-do you have-do you do that often ?
There 's ah =
And why-why do you do that ?
Aah , first ah , I do that to associate with the person I 'm speaking to . You could be speaking very fine Kiswahili really correct , as =
Mm hmm . So you always feel this urge to-to be like the person you are talking to . { To speak , to talk like them }
{ And that 's why I have ah } , learned so many languages . I speak-for vernaculars I can speak Kikuyu and Kimeru , fluently . I also speak ah-and I hear Kiluya yote .
You hear Kiluya ? { How did that happen ? }
Yes . { But for speaking } I had some neighbors ( laughs ) , some Luya neighbors .
So you interacted with them a lot ?
Yes . So I can hear Luya but I c-when it comes to speaking it 's not that much . From that urge of you 're speaking Kiluya " what do you call this in Kiluya ? " So I end up learning .
You end up picking some things along the way .
Yea .
Mm hmm . What are you discussing ? Now , I mean in-with your friends-in class ?
In class right now-
Over the course of the semester , what are you discussing ? Which topics ?
Aah , this semester the main topic has been on ah , the way the semester has been so compressed . Everything { comes at-coming at the same time } .
{ What are they saying ? }
We are still doing cards , this is the last week before exams . We still have cards , we still have assignments , the exam is on Monday , I 'm from a class . So there are classes , assignments , cuts , and the exam is coming-
So what are students saying that they feel-
The exam should have been pushed two weeks farther . We are overloaded , you know . Yea .
