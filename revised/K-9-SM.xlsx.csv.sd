Welcome Alvin to this uuh , interview session . And we 're just talking about the : languages we use in the social setting . So I shall just be asking you some questions .
Yea .
As you respond to them .
Ok . It 's okay .
Okay . And whatever information you 're going to give will go a long way to assist in meeting the objectives of this research . Now the first question that I will ask you Al is that , which kind of language do you normally use with your family ? At home which kind of language do you normally use ?
Now with my family it depends with the : -the person I 'm talking to . Yea , I have different members of the family . If I 'm talking to my-because I have got my granddad and grana . If I talk to them I use my vernacular which is Dholuo .
Dholuo ?
Yea , that 's what I use with them . Because they do n't understand Swahili neither do they understand English . Aah , when I talk to my sisters and brothers , at times we find ourselves talking in Sheng .
Ok .
Yea . But when we talk aah- but majorly it 's sheng . But when I talk to my dad at times maybe through the phone , at times it 's like aah- a mode of aah- I do n’t use sheng , I can decided to use vernacular depending on how he-he starts the conversation . Cuz at times my dad can start with English or Swahili .
Mm hh , and you end up speaking Swahili =
Speaking Swahili with him . Not that fluent but we just speak Swahili . So at times again when my brothers and sisters call , I equally talk to them in Sheng or we at times talk in vernacular . At times you find them saying " I 've missed talking … " Cuz I 've got a brother whose in aah- learning at University of Nairobi . So he tells me " I 've missed talking in vernacular "
In vernacular .
Yea . So it depends with who- the people I 'm talking to at home . Ikiwa ni mzazi , depending on how they-he starts talking . So that is basically how I use the language back at home with my family .
Mm hh , and that applies to all your family members . Most of your family members will also find it um , umm imperative to use a different language depending on the kind of person they are talking to .
Yes , depending on =
So that you find the grana and grandpa . How ? Which language ?
The grana and grandpa , they basically talk in vernacular , Dholuo
In vernacular .
In vernacular . Now again , when maybe I have a friend who has maybe come to visit me because I come closer to the Kisi . We border the Kisi people . I come from Nyanza the farthest part . We border the Kisi . So I have friends who are Kisi . So when maybe they come home to maybe visit me or say hi , I do n't now use vernacular , we now do n't use vernacular because we are going to be maybe sidelining them . So when we are talking aah with my brothers , they are there , my cousins and these people are here , we have to restrict ourselves in either Sheng or , basically it is Sheng . Yea , we do n't use vernacular at that particular point .
Mm hh , so while speaking with your friends , which kind of language do you normally use ?
Now I 've got friends whom we come with from the same ethnic group Luo . I 've got friends who : are aah multi-ethnic , they come from different groups . So when we talk with aah my friends who are : , who are Luo , at times we talk in Sheng , and then we end up maybe bringing in some Dholuo . Yea
Thank you .
And aah , if they are my friends who do n't come from my tribe , cuz I 've friends who come , my roomates who come from Kalenjin community . So we have to , at times we do talk Sheng . Now apart from that we 've got friends who take the same courses as BA Kiswahili students . So when we are together with them we talk fluent Swahili . There 's nothing like Sheng =
Because all of you would understand Swahili ?
We would understand and we want ourselves-we want to get used to- tuwe na uzoefu so that maybe you do n't find like you are a BA Kiswahili and somebody asks you " mbona we unaongea tu Sheng na wewe ni mtu wa Kiswahili ? "
Ni kweli
Yea .
Now , so in what instance would you bring in Dholuo ? Ok you 've just been-we 've been speaking Kiswahili . And what motivates you to bring in Dholuo ?
Now : =
In the conversation with your friends .
With my friends ?
Yea .
Now- it 's got- that applies to my friends who are-who come from the Luo community . So probably-maybe you 're talking about an issue , and you know there are some issues that maybe when you bring it maybe in vernacular it sounds more that authenticity . It sounds even more : aah maybe appealing . And then you find yourselves bursting , and aah I think it has more effect rather then if you would have maybe : if you would have used Swahili or English . Other context is maybe we are just Luos . Maybe you see maybe a lady passing . And maybe she 's caught your eyes . And then you do n't want to maybe somebody : different to hear . So it 's like you talk in vernacular , so in vernacular you 'd say " Bwana umeona huyu mtu amepita " so nobody notices or understands what you said but amongst yourselves you 've noticed and you 've understood that .
So you want to exclude the rest from what you have said ?
The rest . So those are instances when we can use Luo . Apart from that , maybe during aah-because we are , as boys we at times politic . So when we are politicking or we are amongst ourselves , we find ourselves bringing in- using vernacular Dholuo . That is another situation when we can maybe use Dholuo .
Now here in school which kind of language do you prefer ?
Now in school , again it depends with the people I am with , at that particular time . If I am with aah my : course mates , we use Swahili . We use Swahili all through . We use Swahili and maybe if you mess up somebody tells you , they correct you they tell you-
They correct you there and there ?
They tell you " no , it should be like this " . When aah I ’m with my roommates , we use aah-most of the times we use Sheng . But at times aah I try as much as possible to use Swahili , not that plain , because they 'll see you like " Eh , huyu jamaa huyu anashinda tu kuzungumza Kiswahili sanifu ? " . So that 's why half time I use- aah-in my room- my roomates mostly because they also love Sheng so when somebody starts talking to you in Sheng and then here you 're a fluent Swahili , you know it brings like a =
It 's not interesting .
Interesting . So if my roomate starts a conversation and there we are Sheng . When we are at the hostel we use Sheng . Again , when maybe we meet because we 've got these uuh , I fellowship in the CU . So in the CU on Saturdays we have got evangelistic teams . There 's an evangelistic called Nyanza Evangelistic Team , it 's called NET . Now on Saturdays we meet for fellowships . So when we meet there , we do talk in- at times , not all through because it 's Nyanza contains-Nyanza we 've got the Kuria on the other side who do n't understand Dholuo . We 've got the Kisi who do n't understand Dholuo . So at times maybe after people we are through you find yourselves talking to somebody in Dholuo . For instance unaweza mwambia " Ruoth opaki " meaning " Bwana asifiwe " .
Bwana asifiwe .
Yea , so such instances I find myself talking to-I mean talking uuh , vernacular . Another instance is in school , when maybe we 're in the lecture halls . A lecturer-a lecturer maybe : -especially the Swahili courses anakuuliza swali kwa kiswahili . Sasa unaona pale itakubidi wewe mwenyewe utumie lugha sanifu .
Tumia Kiswahili .
Eh he , kutumia lugha sanifu . Another context [ uncertain transcription ] labda sasa ukiwa umeenda kwa idara , pale , labda kuomba usaidizi , ama labda kwenda kuona tu hao hadhiri itakubidi unatumia Kiswahili sanifu .
Now you said you are a BA Kiswahili student ?
Yes
English . Do you think it 's important to learn English at all ?
Mmm , I think it 's-it 's important to learn more than even English . Because now BA Kiswahili we 've got those who take linguistics , lugha raisimu . There are those who take literature , that is fasihi . And there are those who take utafsiri na ufasiri , that is translation and interpretation . So I do take translation . So if you 're in the translation , for you to be competent when translating text , you have to at least know some , be competent in at least two languages . Cause you do n't restrict yourself you , that you 're only a Swahili student so you should only restrict yourself to Kiswahili . Aaah , and I think it 's even important to know even a fourth language if possible cause I know my vernacular mother-tongue Luo , I 'm supposed to know Swahili fairly well , again I know English fairly well , and then I 'm supposed to know my third language which I 'm-aah I 'm supposed to be-I had started learning my French . Because if maybe you find somebody , maybe a transnational , maybe an NGO , maybe contracts you to translate maybe a text or a book . So you know if you only know maybe two languages , it could be maybe you limit your opportunities . You narrow them down to only that . But if you know maybe French , you can translate from French to English , Swahili , you can even end up translating it to your vernacular . So I think it 's very important to know-I mean to learn and be competent in more than one language .
And talking of a native language , do you think it is important for one to learn a native language ?
I think with the current ah-I mean trends , maybe globalization it is very important . For one , aah , if you look at the system right now , for instance with the Kenyan context , we 've got this devolution . And devolution it means maybe you might find yourself working in maybe epidim- , in your own county . And uuh maybe you maybe are doing some research . It 's going to be very hard for you to get that information from-in as much as you maybe you might hire people , translators , but the effect wouldv 'e been different when you get the information as a researcher . You get that information yourself . So venee : - , I think vernacular , my native language , it 's very important to learn . Apart from that , when uuh , during holidays I do go home . Maybe after a long time maybe , but we , at times we are based in Kisumu . So I at times go home during the holidays maybe to say hi . So when you get home you 'll find uuh , the grannies , people who do n't-they have n't seen you for quite some time , so you remember a scenario when somebody greets you . A granny who can n't speak Swahili , can n't speak English greets you and then you 're here , you 're there " mzuri sana , habari yako , mzuri sana " , you know . ( Both are laughing )
She expects you actually to respond in your native =
In vernacular . So in such a scenario , you find yourself they 'll even be might be spiteful . " Huyu kijana anaringa . Alienda akasoma akasahau lugha yake ya ki = "
Alisahau lugha yetu ya mama-
Aa aah . So it 's very important to know your vernacular . Apart from that , when you get home you might find that umm , I went , there was a time when I was home there was a funeral . And then it happened that in that funeral there was uuh-I mean there were in-laws . Others came from Luyaland , wengine walitoka kule Ukikuyuni . Sasa wale watu tunapotoa ushuhuda , the eulogy ni kwamba it had to , wale ma the grannies , the elders , the elderly people they would maybe tell something they knew about the deceased . So in such a scenario , it had a-nobody would just do that so I came in , and as they were talking , conversing , he talks and then I translate into Swahili for everybody else to understand because when maybe it 's a funeral that is a very big gathering , and composed of different people . So if you 're there and you start speaking only in one langauge which , that is the native language which is Dholuo , these other people they would feel a bit of sidelined . They would not feel part and parcel of =
The whole gathering .
The whole gathering . Yea so I think it 's very important to-In as much as people shy away from doing that , from learning their native language , it 's very important .
Why do you think people would shy away from learning their native language or even , umm , exposing themselves , that they know this language ?
Now , I think some of the reason , probably , it could be because of some people do n't want to be identified with their-that particular tribe . You ask somebody ' are you a Luo ? ' , the next thing maybe he thinks you 're going to ask " do you understand Dholuo , how do you say this in Dholuo ? " That 's one . Another thing , is that I think people have been-I mean there is that feeling of pride . Somebody does n't want-I mean you want to be proud if you speak- somebody thinks that if you speak in English huambia mtu mimi Kijaluo ah ah ! Mimi sielewi . Labda ukimwambia hivo ataona we sio msomi . You 're not learned . Not thinking that even the learned people still-you still need to know your vernacular . So-and apart from that people want to be associated with , mostly English . People mostly want to be associated with English because it ' seen-English uuh-people have that perception . That it 's uuh , maybe it 's for the people who are high , in the hierarchy , social class . So people tend to think that when I speak in English , I 'll be like associated or classified with the high , and the mighty , the social ladder up there . As expected maybe you speak in your vernacular . Apart from that , another thing is influence . Influence from the media . And uuh , I mean-because the media-most people want to-nowadays-the media-for instance the music people listen to especially the youth of my age . Somebody listens to maybe blues , somebody listens to rock and therefore he all the time wants to speak in English . Somebody listens to maybe the local music that are sung in uuh , maybe that are sung in Sheng , so all the time you are there as a youth , somebody wants to see you-all the time you are in-like you want to speak in Sheng . All the time in Sheng . Yea ?
So we have mentioned English , Kiswahili , Sheng and Dholuo . Do you find yourself mixing these languages maybe in one conversation ? Or even two of these languages maybe in one conversation ?
Yea . Mmh , I think I have found myself severally doing that because you know now when you look at Sheng-and I think even Kikuyu comes in . For the Sheng you find that Sheng is not only composed of English and Swahili . Most vocabularies and terminologies we find in Sheng , there 's some of them come from Kikuyu .
Okay .
Because mostly Sheng is created in Nairobi . And uhh , for instance if you look at shosho , the word shosho . Shosho you know is not a standard Swahili word , and it 's not an English word . It comes from Kikuyu word ' susu ' which they call ' shosho ' . So you find that in Sheng , where when I speak Sheng maybe with my-maybe with my colleagues or with people my agemates , you 'll find that I 'll end up speaking Dholu-I mean I 'll end up speaking uuh-I mean English , Swahili and another third language Kikuyu unknowingly . Because simply you do n't know . You only speak-you 'll find a Sheng =
Within Sheng .
Yea .
Wow , that 's interesting .
Yea . You 'll find that uuh maybe a terminology has been created in Nairobi . Through the media , the music we listen to , its trickles down to people who are not within Nairobi . People who are outside the confines of Nairobi . So in such a scenario , it grows and then it comes in , and then people start using them not even knowing that what is the basis-what is the origin of this word . What does this word mean . So in such a situation I find myself using more than one-more than one language .
Now when do you find yourself using more than one language maybe ? In what scenario ?
Now one , maybe : if I 'm talking over the phone , uuh , somebody calls me . So you know I love to maybe perhaps give an immediate answer and probably I do n't know the word , if maybe I 'm speaking in English , but I can n't find the word immediately . So you find that I go for the word that I can reach easily . For instance somebody starts talking in Swahili , and then there 's a Swahili- we talk in Swahili : and then at some particular point I 'm not able to find a Swahili word I go for an English word . And then in such uuh a situation I end up using-I mean a word that it does n't belong to Swahili . Another situation is uuh-maybe especially us , maybe you want to go after maybe a chic , a girl . So in such a situation maybe you want to-you-you have some interest , you want maybe a friendship . So in such a scenario you 're there like in , Swahili , plain Swahili =( Both laugh )
That 's not interesting to =
It 's not interesting to her . She will-she might even shy away from you . But if you start using Sheng , she 'll equally use Sheng .
Okay .
Another situation is maybe : when chatting on facebook . There 's that social media . Somebody maybe poses something in , using maybe Sheng . And especially when the language that now is used . The language used nowadays in the shortened , I mean uuh-
The short form of words .
The short form of words . I find myself using them , often . Or even when chatting through texts .
You talked about using this kind of language or mixing these languages to suit these people maybe of your age ?
Yea
Okay . So the question is , you normally change the language to suit the person you 're talking to , especially the person of your age . Why do you normally do that ?
Now , I do that for-for one reason is to : maybe please that person . I want to have the attention of that person as he communicates . Cuz probably if somebody starts speaking in Sheng and then I bring in Swahili , this person might see me boring-see a-like maybe a boring guy and then shy-walks away . And uh , another-another thing-so maybe that is to please that particular person . Another thing is that I want to-maybe the information I wanted to relay to be understood , better . Because for instance , if maybe : I wanted to say something funny in Sheng , you know if you say the English equivalence would not sound funny =
Would just be plain
Plain . But if I bring Sheng , it would sound a lot of-I mean it would sound uh- sound funny and maybe be understood better . Bring the- create that humor .
And talking of mixing of languages , which languages do you find yourself mixing the most ?
Mostly it 's English and Swahili . Basically those two . English and Swahili .
English and Swahili .
Yea .
Okay . And Sheng ?
Now Sheng , I think =
Is it a mixture of English or Swahili ?
Now Sheng ,
Not only English or Swahili or the other languages .
Or the others . Because Sheng-bu t-t he majority of uuh-majority . Basically , what forms majorly the Sheng terminologies are-the bulk of it is Swahili , and English in as much as there are other-I mean uh-there are languages-I mean there are terminologies from-take-that are borrowed from other languages . Ya- from-for instance the Luo , their terminology is borrowed . Aaah , I mean and the Kikuyu .
Okay . Here in school , do you notice that you speak differently from other students ? Maybe ?
Yea , I do notice that . Because uuh , for one . At times when we-maybe I communicate to somebody . I do communicate I try so much because I want to , niwe na ule uzoefu I want to be used to speaking Swahili because I am a Swahili expert .
Okay .
So you find that mostly I do speak in plain so-uhh , I mean standard Swahili , Kiswahili sanifu . Kiswahili sanifu . So anytime when maybe I walk around , or I 'm in the room , when I see something I try picturing " How do we call this in Swahili ? How do we call this in Swahili ? " So even people do know , that for instance I [ uncertain transcription ] a group who take translation . Somebody wants uuh-something to-maybe something that is in Swahili , you 'll find he 'll come to you " How do you call this in Swahili ? " So they notice that these people talk differently .
So for your case you talk Swahili differently .
I talk Swahili differently . For instance yesterday I was in the library at around 8 . And then there was a lady who was doing some research . And eeh she comes from the : School of Education . So she was uh- she studied Swahili because there are courses we share . She takes Kiswahili and religion . So when we were there , I think she was doing something in the schemes of work , but in Swahili now . So she came to me- she was asking some other group " How do you call schemes of work in Kiswahili ? "
In Kiswahili .
So those people were there like " Ey ! Hatujui " . But she saw me and approached me akaniuliza " Eh ! Nimeshindwa kupata " Nikamwambia schemes of work is called maazimio ya kazi .
Maazimio ya kazi .
Ya kazi .
( Inaudible comment/joke/question by interviewer . Both giggle )
So I do speak differently .
So you can also say that your Kiswahili group would speak a different form of Kiswahili from the rest of the students who can also speak Kiswahili .
Yes , definitely . Because for one , maybe the terminologies uuh , we do use at times , differ . And we try so much to-because we want to get used to- that is the main reason . You want to get used to it , and uuh-I mean communicate fairly well . You could never know where you might land and you 're a Swahili expert . So we do speak-I mean the standard Kiswahili , which is very different from the rest who speak Swahili .
Now when people from your area speak Swahili maybe , or any other language , can you notice " these are people from my area ? "
Yes .
Maybe ?
I can notice that . Because you know , language is , mostly language is used as that social identity . There 's a function of language social identity . So people from , that is my tribe-for instance if they speak Swahili , the Swahili they speak is like uh , very broken . You 'll just notice , this is a Luo . ( Alvin sounds like he is smiling , interviewer giggles ) Apart from that if they speak English , some of them who are maybe-Luos , because some people say Luos can speak Swahili , I mean English in two different ways . They can either speak it very well , fluently , or very poorly . And that is they prolong-there is that-maybe if somebody maybe pronounces a word , he or she prolongs-prolongs a word . For instance uh , uuh , if maybe somebody wants to say " teacher " . You 'll find the person saying ' teeacher ' . You see so =
So it 's in the way they pronounce .
The way they pronounce .
How else ?
Uuh , apart from that , Luos when they speak Swahil-I mean English , you 're able to notice if-if uh- they 're people maybe : some individuals at least have some-maybe they 've gone to school , a little bit . They 're learned . The English they speak is uh , uuh-like their accent is from-they try to : -their accent is a little bit refined . So : it 's refined in a way that uh-at times it 's very hard to notice . But at times maybe somebody starts speaking and I 'm able to see this is a Luo . The way he speaks , he 's a Luo . Yea .
Okay . Yea so , if somebody beyond this wall speaks and you overheard them talk , if somebody beyond this wall , that you cannot see , speak and , can you tell what kind of background that person has had .
Definitely . I 'm able to tell . Because uuh , just like I said before , language can be used as social identity , or maybe you can use them to trace and identify the ethnic background from which the person is speaking . For instance if you look at the Luya , if a Luya speaks Swahili , you are able to tell . Even when-even if somebody now-let 's say somebody is speaking over the phone or the radio . You do n't see them at all , you are able to tell ' this is a Luya ' . You are able to tell ' this is a Kalenjin ' . You are able to tell that this guy is a Kikuyu , the way he speaks he 's a Kikuyu . The way this guy speaks Swahili he 's a Luo . And then either he 's a Kisi , you are able to tell this somebody from Modista . So I 'm able to tell if somebody speaks , I 'm able to tell . However , there are situations , when you can n't tell . Cuz that person-you might try so hard to classify this person , into their tribal setting , but it 's very hard because their people speak-they never grew up in their-I mean their native land or where their-their forefathers are . So such people , it 's very hard . Somebody speaks and you 'll not be able to tell . If somebody asks you " are you able to tell from which tribe this person comes from ? " it 's really hard to tell with some people .
Hard to tell .
But more often than not , you 're able to tell .
Mm hh . So it 's all in- what makes umm these people so : obvious that they come from this ethnic community ?
Now , uh I think , uh when you look at , the language , uuh , the way these people speak , you 're able to-the pronounciation-now for one , if you look at uh the : my-my-my Luo , the Luo vernacular . You 'll find if this person speaks in English , they 'll tend to omit ' h ' , because the ' h ' is not in the vowels there . In the Luo vowels , we do n't have ' h ' . So instead of maybe saying , somebody saying ' shilling ' , that person will say ' silling ' , because ' h ' is not there .
Is not there .
Again , if you look at the : , the Kisi . If the Kisi speaks maybe : - , mm , they-they do n't have ' r ' , the ' r ' . So where ' l ' , ' r ' is supposed to be there , they place ' l ' . For instance if they say maybe-uuh , if somebody is-for instance ' chakula ' , watasema ' chakura ' , chakura , simply because that ' l ' is not there . Lala watasema rara . And you know , it 's something that uh , maybe somebody does n't want to speak but it 's something that has been , it 's taught . It 's unconscious . You 've learned it for quite some time , it 's there in your conscious . So when you speak , even if you do n't intend to , just things start coming out . Yea .
Ok , now apart from the ethnic-the ethnic thing , now can you tell also the level of education they have had maybe , from the way they speak .
Yea , to some extent you 're able to tell . And uh-to-maybe to : -but at times , it 's very hard because , there are people who maybe they 're learned they have , maybe their undergraduate degree . But still their accent has not changed . So when that person speaks Swahili , it 's the same as that person's same accent . Because here you will not talk accents maybe in the level of education when you go to school , you 're not taught how to pronounce . You 're not taught maybe how to change . You 're only taught maybe , you 're taught maybe if it 's morphology , English morphology you 're taught English morphology . So um the pronounciation , or how you use your language , that maybe you acquire over the time because you find that these languages somebody acquired this over a very long time when you are at home because maybe the level of education is only-you maybe go through it for only , for five years ten years . So when that is in-built in you , it 's very hard to change . And maybe do things differently . Apart from that , uuh , and I 've even witnessed this , some students especially the ones they do n't take maybe the language courses , when he speaks Swahili or English , that is when you 'll find them excusing themselves " I 'm studying engineering " ( laughter between Alvin and interviewer ) " I do n't understand English " . And you 'll find most of them use Sheng . Especially those who take courses that are different from-those who come from School of Business , you 'll find them telling you " Um , mimi sisomei lugha "
So they want to avoid using the standard ?
The standard . And they have got excuses that are very readily available . They tell you " Mimi label='quotation ' , I 'm not a language expert . Mine is I want to go to the bank . And bank I 'll only deal with money I 'll not be communicating , I 'll not talk to people . " The same to those who take engineering . So you know in such a situation it 's very hard to tell . Cuz somebody when the very very Sheng that person used when he had not may have acquired education is the same . In as much as that person has now matured up .
So you 're saying , the kind of English that person speaks , would be the same English any other person out there , who has not gone to maybe any school but has just learned English from speaking ?
Mm , no . What I 'm saying , in other-they 'll change because some things come naturally . But the English will differ . The English that person uses would be different and this person maybe somebody speaks you 're able to tell , at least this and this person went through some school setting . So you 're able to tell that .
Now out there in the society , when somebody speaks maybe English or Kiswahili can you tell which position in the society ? Which class maybe ?
Umm , when some people I think you 're able to tell-because one , uuh- especially if you look at uuh , maybe somebody with uuh , maybe he has studied . He has maybe a doctorate . He has studied and like he 's a professor or a doctor , so when these people speak , you 're able to tell that this person , uh , the way he speaks , and uh-the way he speaks he 's uh- maybe this guy is learned and he 's like uh-in the society-this society holds that person with a lot of esteem . Yea . And they-it 's regarded highly .
So he 'll actually choose his words ?
He chooses his words . However , at some particular point that person-you 'll have to-because for instance if maybe you 're a doctor , or a professor , maybe lecturing English , you know the English he 'll be using at the lecture halls is not the same English you go home and then you 're with the family members and you 're with the same language your English . Or you get back at home or maybe a setting that maybe you get back home now , that a group that maybe you-where not everybody is learned , so such gatherings these people will not want to look like-There are people who never-maybe dropped out , of Form One [ uncertain transcription ] and then you are there with fluent English . So I think it depends .
So somebody would tone down depending on the setting =
The setting .
And the people he 's talking to .
Yea .
Again , if you overheard maybe somebody speaking , and you 're not seeing that person , can you tell what kind of political affiliation ?
Mm , yea you-you can be able to tell-whoever-I mean uh-whichever political divide this person belongs to . Because definitely , if this person talks you 'll find him maybe criticizing some particular person , or maybe praising the other person .
Okay .
For instance if we : -you look at right now , you 'll find people criticizing the budget that was just read the other day . Saying " Ah ! These guys are imposing a lot of-they 're going to impose a lot of tax on us . We will never wanted-this is why I never wanted this guy . I knew it from the very beginning that 's why I did n't want to vote him " So you 're able to tell . Some people-you 'll find some people saying " You know , in as much as my-this guy lost , he 's still my hero . So and so is still my hero , even if-whether he lost , I still love him and he 's my president . " So you know , when that person speaks , you 're able to tell which-which I mean-
Which political party .
Party .
Or their personality .
Personality . And then , another thing is that uh , half of these people tend to maybe judge wrongly .
Okay .
Because for instance , I might be-I hear somebody whose talking , maybe talking Kikuyu . And then I just judge that because most of our political parties are ethnic based in Kenya .
Okay .
If you find ah , a Luo , definitely a Luo would want to belong to CORD . Most Luos would want to belong to CORD . So when I hear somebody speaking Luo I 'll know " Ah ! This is who comes from CORD . " If so I hear this is a Kikuyu , yea I 'll tend to think-and I think that is being so stereotypic . You 'll think that this guy since he comes from central , he must be : belonging to Jubilee , TNA , which I think is bad because not everybody who is in Nyanza belongs to CORD . Not everybody who is in maybe aah Rift Valley belongs to URP . Not everybody who is westerd comes from UDF . So at times in as much as we are able to tell , but we end up making-at times we do make wrong judgements .
Wrong judgements .
Yea .
Given the kind of language that you are- you speak may not tell , the kind of political-
Yea , at times it cannot tell .
But what you say ?
What you say ?
Mm hmm .
Tells .
Do you ever find yourself speaking different languages to different people ?
Yes , I do speak different languages to different people . Because for instance uuh , the language I 'll speak , use to speak to : the maybe the women or the Mama Mboga , those who sell vegetables there , I will not get to the market where they sell vegetables and then start speaking in English , or in fluent Swahili . It would not make sense .
So I 'll have to go use the language they-simple Swahili which they understand . " Mama , mboga unauza pesa ngapi ? " , like that . Because if I go there " How much are you selling these tomatoes ? " , even people who are there will just like loo-look at you and really wonder . So again , if maybe they 're boda boda people there . It 's again uh , it would be-yea I think that person would really wonder . This is somebody who has-he sees you are maybe somebody who is in Kenya-maybe-you understand Swahili , if you live in Kenya , you know Swahili . So I 'll definitely speak Swahili with them . If uh , apart from that , the language I 'll again use , when uh , I address my peers ,
Your peers .
Mostly most of them is Sheng . Because uh , when you converse and then you 're like purely English , purely Swahili , it again-it does n't uuh-I mean it 's not fun . You do n't get that fun . But when you 're there you 're in English , at times you speak Swahili , I mean Sheng . You find the conversation enjoyable , and very interesting .
And uh-another uuh-again , if for instance maybe I want uh , I 've gone to see the dean of students , or the DVC , and then I 'm there and I start speaking Sheng , it will sound so bad . So when I get to such offices where maybe I want help , I 'll have to use the offical languages . And mostly , the official languages now-in as much as Swahili is an official language , I do n't think-it has that status but it has not been implemented fully . Because , if you approach somebody in an office , and then due to the-just because Kiswahili is uh , an official language , it 's even there in the constitution , and then you 're like there you start speaking with him Swahili he 'll ask you " Hey , can you speak English ? " . People have not really-I mean taken that . But I 'll find myself using English mostly . Yea .
Ok . Now you-you acknowledged the fact that you speak differently . Now , have you ever tried to change , the way you talk ?
Mmh , I think I 've uh , I have . I must ait that . Because uh , the language I speak when I came here during-when I was in high school back then , is very different , from the way I speak right now . My Swahili , when I was-I came uh-enrolled , when I registered , I came here my first year , it was very different .
Okay .
It was a very crooked one . So over the time I 've changed , and I 've really wanted to speak and associate with uh , Swahili .
What makes you to want to change ? The way you speak . Or what motivates you to change that the way you speak ?
Now , what motivates me , one , is that uh I want to be identified as belonging to that particular group . If I 'm a Swahili student , I 'll want to belong there fully . And when I speak Kiswahili and you , maybe you hear you 'll find some people saying " Ai ! That is somebody who takes BA , BA Kiswahili . " And uh , another thing is that uh , my English , apart from that . When you maybe address a congregation . Another thing that would make me-would make all-would make somebody to change , is the society itself . In that , society expects you-when this person has gone through this particular very rigourous education system or academic system , and then he still speaks like a class eight kid , people would want to-people would really wonder . Because you-when you get there you want to now attain that level and status in the society . When somebody hears you speak you like " Eh ! That guy . He went to university and uh , the way he speaks tells it all . " So that , again the society itself I think places that pressure in you .
And the society expects you actually to speak the way you should .
The way you should
When you have gone through education
When you have gone through education because even uh , in as much as we do use Sheng , you 're there , maybe you 've graduated and you-maybe you 're at an age of thirty-five and you still have the Sheng you were using when you were in high school or you were thirteen people will really wonder , have you-because education is supposed to [ inaudible ] , you become mentored , you mature . That 's why we do study .
Even in the kind of language-
The kind of language should mature up .
Okay . Now , what kind of issues do you talk about with your friends nowadays ? What is the current issue that you talk about ?
Now the issues we do talk about are very numerous . For one , we do talk issues concerning sports . Sports a lot , especially maybe about the Kenyan premier league itself . About maybe the UFA , about uh-I mean the champions league-
The champions ' league .
Yea . So those are some of the things that we do talk about . Apart from that , uh , we do talk about politics and it about politics . Especially : the conclusi-I mean elections were concluded-just , it 's not so far . And there are a lot of things going on right now in Kenya . Like there 's wrangels between the house , the senate , the national assembly , So you find out yourself discussing , after watching the news you ask yourselves " What 's your point of view on this ? how do you see things ? " You ask you " Eh , I do n't see , it 's not okay " . So another thing we do talk about is like uh , issues to do with relationships . Maybe you-you stressed up , you 're dating maybe some girl and then this girl you find this girl with somebody else . Or maybe you 've got differences . So you know you 'll approach your friend and open up to . Cuz I know everybody has a friend , that you can open up to and share .
Okay .
So in such a situation , you find this friend and then you like ' Bana , it 's this and this , we had these differences , how can we go about it ? " And then you-it 's like that . Or somebody asks you " Nowadays I do n't-I-I see you , maybe walking around with several ladies , what is it all about ? " So you find yourselves talking issues like that . Apart from that , we 've got friends that we can talk about family issues . I 've got a friend maybe there 's a problem back at home , umm , maybe he has not been sent money and he does n't have that money for upkeep . And you know that is a friend whom , you truly know him background . He tells you " Back at home it 's like this , my mom and my dad have this problem , could you please give-maybe lend me some cash I will get it back to you " . So we find ourselves talking about that . And when it comes to politics now , again right now in campus , elections are just-elections are supposed to be held because those who are in the students ' governing council , SGC , they 're supposed-most of them are fourth years who are going home .
Ok
And there 's again a constitution there 's supposed to be-I mean they 're supposed to have-some ammenents are supposed to be done to it . So in such situation , we find ourselves talking to-talking about , uh I mean about uh , about politics . Far from politics , we also do talk about maybe academic issues .
Okay .
Because for instance you 've got an assignment you 've been given . You 've tried , you 've gone through the internet , you 've gone through the books , you 've-not finding something-I mean relevant to this . Maybe you approach your friends as you wait for the lecture hall , lecture hall , you are at the lecture hall waiting for the lecturer to come , you 're like " How do you see , I went through it and I 'm not finding anything . How did you go about it ? " So basically [ uncertain transcription ] , so basically politics or issues to do with relationships-
Sports .
Sports . Uuh , issues with academics and uh , at large that 's for short . Issues .
Why do you talk about these issues ?
Now , some of them are very-some of them are inevitable because they are a part of us .
Okay .
You can n't just stake , like uh , some of them are inherent in-for instance if you take something maybe like academics , I 'm a student . And if all my time I do n't even talk about it people will wonder because I sometimes I find it something that is so : maybe disturbing . So some of them are just inherent that you can n't sideline ourselves from them because they are issues , they are realities in the society . You can n't just like uh-I mean uuh , you 'll just sideline yourself from the society . You can n't lock yourself in your own closet because you need to develop . And uh , for a normal human being , for you to develop fairly well and uh-you need to grow be multi-in all dimensions . You need to grow in all dimensions . You need to grow academics , you need to =
Socially .
Socially . You need to socialize as yourself you socialize with people around . You need to know about politics because it 's here , cuz it would be very-somebody asks you , " Who is the current [ uncertain transcription ] secretary in Kenya ? ' " Now due to the fact that you do n't like politics so you-I mean because you do n't want to listen to news , like some people are they were saying most of the time when the news starts it 's " so and so , so and so " . So in such a situation , we can n't just avoid them . Some they are inevitable . Yea .
And when we speak about these issues , we still bring in the issue of language . What kind of language do we talk about this ? What kind of language maybe do we use in talking about these issues ?
Now the kind of language we use varies depending on the context or the topic to be discussed . If maybe you 're watching football match , and you 're there . Maybe you 're a group of maybe soccer fanatics , you 're watching the game , you 'll find yourselves talking probably with the youths , Sheng . And maybe if it 's a social issue , maybe I have something so pressing , and then I go to : maybe a peer counselor . That is , you know there is a social issue , a relationship I 'll need to explain that well to her in English because that is now a formal set up .
Okay .
Yea , and maybe again I meet my lecturer . I want some assistance or maybe somehow maybe I 'm doing some research . For instance right now third year our group are doing some project , proposal . So maybe there 's a part you do n't understand . You have to go there and explain it in Swahili cuz the research you 've done , the project is all about Swahili . So it will be very irrelevant I 'm there with English and the research is all about Swahili . So the context will determine the type of language we use , it varies . I can n't say that I want to use English in all of them . I 'm talking to : like my friend we discussing about soccer it 's English . I 'm with my coursemates it 's English . I 'm with my roomates it 's English . No . I think the society some of these things have been set up by the society itself .
Okay .
Yea .
Now talking about these languages that we normally call informal . Maybe the Sheng , what do you think should be done , with the Sheng . Do we : -do we have to incorporate them into-make it official maybe ? Or , what do you think ?
Now Sheng , I think uuh , what we need to do is uh , just sensitize people . Because uh , if we now want to try to like uh , bring Sheng to be formal , I think as a society we are headed to a very bad place .
Okay .
Because [ inaudible false starts ] you : can imagine a scenario you are in an office or maybe you 're reading a : -because if it is now official . If Sheng is to be official , the constitution will have to recognize that , you will find a constitution written in Sheng . You remember-uh-I mean you can imagine how that would be . It would be so awkward .
Okay .
So the only way is to embrace Sheng and sensitize the youth . That in as much as Sheng is okay , use it to identify yourself as being a youth , because right now the youths if you do n't speak Sheng people will say " You 're like uh-so much localized , you 're just = "
You 're too plain .
You 're too plain , you 're so much- ' wewe uli-ni waushagoo , wewe ulizaliwa ushagoo uliishi huko huwezi ukazungumza Sheng ? So the only thing you can do to something like Sheng is to embrace it and sensitize the youth . Because we need uh , people-and Sheng you know is not international for one .
Okay .
It 's only spoken in uh : maybe : -now because Sheng , probably if you look at the language-if for instance you go to Tanzania , there are a group of people who do n't speak pure Swahili . You 'll find some words from there-the different communities that are there . So it 's not an international language . So if we were to put it to be official or if we were to encourage people to use it , somebody gets so used to it-maybe you travel to : for instance you travel to Germany , you will not find people who speak Sheng there . So you 'll find it very hard communicating , simply because you are used to speaking to Sheng . But if you speak to-uh-in English , English is ver-is an international language , if you go to whatever country you go to , you 'll find-even if you go to France you 'll still find people speaking in ? In English . You can go to Germany , it applies there . So Sheng , the only thing you can do to it is sensitize people . Cuz if again you 'll want to , like root Sheng out of the languages , this means that you 're going to kill a lot of-especially the musicians . In Kenya mos t-t he musicians especially the local artists use Sheng . And this is how it has influenced-and apart from that , if you look at the media . Right now we 've got individuals who are in the media . They do n't use tha t-t he language they use it 's purely Sheng or at times that broken Swahili . Cuz if you look at QFM , the guy who you , they are just there . And most stations nowadays they 're embracing them because they want audience , they want people to listen to them . Cuz if you-like it 's a station that speaks uses-for instance ABC , that you 've got none of this comedians there who maybe speak very broken . For instance if you look at somebody like Jelaa , who says maybe kalamu changu ( chuckles ) . So , you 'll find that-
So that is funny in itself .
It 's funny and they want to get audience .
Okay .
Because uh , they are-these are business set ups . These people want to make money . So another thing that we can do about Sheng in Kenya , right now , is like uh , in high schools , in as much as it is discouraged , but when people still confine themselves into some closets when teachers are not around , they 're still speaking this . And it affects-that even when somebody maybe a class-a Form Two writes a composition or uh-that imaginative , you 'll find some traces of Sheng . In tha t-t races , even in [ inaudible ] you 'll find some traces of Sheng . So the only way is to sensitize the youth and that should be done thoroughly well . Telling them that this language , use it because it 's not bad using it , just use it . But more often try using English and Swahili . Yea .
Now you do Bachelor of Arts in Kiswahili . If you were given a chance to do , maybe a Bachelor of Arts maybe in English , would you take English or Kiswahili . And maybe why ?
Now , to me I think I 'll take Swahili , uh and I think that was again a motivating factor for me . Because for one , what I said is , the English I know right now I think is uh-is enough for me to communicate fairly well .
Okay .
But um , I was so poor in Swahili . So I wanted at least to learn that Swahili so that at least I have some level of uh-cuz mostly , where I came from people do n't speak Swahili that much . More oftenly it 's English . So English um-ah-wam-ah-I was very comfortable with English . I can speak it well , communicate .
And people from your area can even speak good English .
Good English . So I-so I-
So it 's Kiswahili which is not being spoken very well .
Very well .
And you wanted to demystify the fact that people from that area cannot learn .
Cannot learn because , even when I came-at times I do speak . So when you speak somebody asks you-maybe it 's a list going around , somebody sees your name [ Alvin ] , [ Alvin ] um my name is [ says full name ] .
Okay .
So when somebody sees [ says his Luo last name ] " Eh ! Mjaluo you 're a Luo and you 're taking Kiswahili ! " ( laughter between Alvin and interviewer )
They do expect that people from that area cannot take Kiswahili ?
Cannot take Kiswahili . They only want to see you probably : , maybe if it 's English they say " Oh , we 're used to-that is very-that is not news . [ inaudible ] , that is not news we 've seen people " . But if it 's Kiswahili , they 'll say " Ah ?! Uh uh . " ( laughter )
Okay . Maybe what is the attitude of people from those are-from that area towards English , or maybe towards Kiswahili ?
People from my area , mmh ! Regard English highly as compared to Kiswahili .
Okay .
And uh : , I think the reason-not even people from my area . Most people-most people-and I think this has some : -because if you look at some : -at some point when you look at Kenya . It can be traced back-if I was to give you a brief-a very brief history , of this . In Kenya some back-for instance Kiswahili , during the colonial period . When these people came , uuh-there was that uh-they wanted to : really have aah : -I mean influence these people to change . So Kiswahili , the reason why-most people really have a negative attitude towards it is colonization . In aah : Tanzania , when aah : the Germany first came , they came there , started teaching people Kiswahili , so that to : enable to facilitate the colonization process . So that after the end of World War II , that is 1939-1945 , they were defeated . The Germans were defeated . And then now the British went into Tanzania . So when the British went , uuh , people were learning Swahili . And Swahili was spreading far and wide . So when they went there they told uh-they removed-they were associating Kiswahili with Islam .
Okay
So they saw that , if we really teach people Swahili , we 'll like be teaching them Islam because most of Swahili words are borrowed . A very big percentage is borrowed from : , Ara-Ara-Arabic .
Okay .
Is borrowed from Arabic . So they saw that " If we spread Swahili , it 's like we 're spreading Islam and yet we 've come here to establish Christianity " . So they started uh : like teaching people English . That is when they started people-teaching people English . So again as-we saw-when people started seeing that-now they saw " Kiswahili is bad " cuz they influenced people and people changed . People now saw " English is associated with these people and therefore we want to speak in English . " So this is something that has been passed on from generation to generation . And it 's even here today , people do n't want to speak in Swahili so , it 's a very long history , it 's not something that just started yesterday . It started-something that started long time ago . So that is why people from my area and uh , very many regions do n't want to speak in Kiswahili .
Kiswahili . You talked about fellowshipping with a Christian union ,
Yea .
Which kind of language do you normally use ?
Now : , language-we use there in : -during aah , the preaching , when they preach there 's preach-uh , they preach in English , purely . It 's not transla-there 's not transala-translated or interpretated here . Cuz everybody understands English fairly well . And then if it is uh : -probably : the interactions , service has come to an end , you now interact before you finally leave the : church , you have to : -at times you interact-you find yourself talking Swahili , Sheng . Somebody asks you " Ey , niaje ? . You know that is Sheng ? You tell- somebody asks you " Niaje ? " and then you tell them " good " . ( laughter ) You know so you 'll have to say " Ah , poa " so you know what you find yourself using ?
Mm hh ?
Sheng .
Okay . So thanks so much Alvin . And uh , to that we have come to the end of this interview session . And I really want to appreciate for your time , and the kind of information you have given me .
Yea .
Thank you for that .
You 're welcome .
