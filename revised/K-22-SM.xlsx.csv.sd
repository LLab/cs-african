So today we are going to discuss about how we use language in our everyday life . Your everyday usage of language . So what-what kind of language do you use your-with your family ?
With my family ? With my family , aah inaringana ni nani in my family . Yea my-for example when with my brother we can speak in English . But with my mom most it is Dholuo . Then with my sister in school we also speak maybe Kiswahili or English so majorly it depends on who is speaking . But then , mm let ’s say with my dad . My dad mostly is someone who does not want us to speak with him these other languages that we learnt at school . Tunataka tukiongea tunaongea ile lugha ambae ye ali-alijuwa akizaliwa and that is the native language that is his father and mother ’s language that is Dholuo . My dad would never speak to you in any other language . Whether he knows it or not . Even though he knows English but huwahasemi . Ye hata kama anataka kukuuliza kitu he 'll just say , “ Okello come here ” na akuulize , hi ni hivi but it ’s just in your mother tongue . He does not ask in any other language .
So the language used depends on the person .
Yea , the language I use depends on the person that aah , I ’m speaking or the person that is near me .
Okay , what about your friends ?
Umm , friends now that ’s interesting . My friends we speak and we speak each and every language . Yea . Again friends also , it also depends like let ’s say when we are at home I have-I mix a lot with people yea so you find that most of my friends some of them are not learned , hawajui Kiswahili wala Kiingereza . But even though Kiswahili at least unapata the wanajuajua ile kidogo . Kila mtu anaweza hata akaomba naye chumvi label='refereeing ' at least wanajua . So let 's-so tuseme niko nyumbani na naongea na hao watu maybe we can speak Kiswahili . But mostly my friends they speak Sheng .
Both friends at home , friends in school ?
Yea . Friends at home , friends in school , yea mostly unapata ni Sheng .
Okay .
But again it depends on whatever you ’re talking about . You ’ll see if whatever you ’re speaking is something that is formal . Yea , if it ’s formal then the languages that you use that is either Kiswahili or English .
Okay . What about informal context like now here in campus ... Which language do you usually use your friends .. maybe your lecturers , it ’s in school now .
In school =
You find yourself using which kind of language ?
In school mostly it ’s Kiswahili .
Kiswahili .
Because me as a person I like Kiswahili as a language . So most of the time I like using Kiswahili so that I improve my knowledge in it and also my understanding and how people view . Mostly it 's Kiswahili that has been helping me from high ss-from primary to high school to here . So most of the time I like Kiswahili . Hata let ’s say we are in a formal setup and people are doing introductions . Mostly I do it in Kiswahili because I just-I think I love Swahili .
You just love Swahili .
Yea and then my love for Kiswahili began in primary school where we had a teacher known as Mr. Henry Lanana . And that was the best teacher I 've ever had in fact all through to a university sijawaiona mwalimu anafundisha kama yeye . Cuz when you came-when he came to class he used to start with us on aah-with a methali , he ’d write methali on the board , first what it means , reads a story about that methali , then after that he goes an-how this now how the [ uncertain transcription ] , he ’ll tell you what it means , then how-eeh-aah-how you can apply it . So you see that from there we developed an interest in the Swahili language . So from there he just used to go on until the time-I think there ’s a time that Walla bin Walla , this famous writer , author in Swahili primary books , Kiswahili moved-came to school and you see by then we were in Class Seven and we were not allowed to go . So it was only meant for the Class Eight . But being that we had that interest in Swahili the head teacher mmmm took eight of us from Class Seven and we went to [ uncertain transcription ] and you see , in fact that also boosted my interest-my interest in Swahili language because when I went there I saw the man and that the one I 'd been longing to see ati “ eh ! huyu mtu si ako na Kiswahili poa . Ninatamani kumuona ” . ( they both laugh ) So ile time tulienda huko na nikamuona and I asked him a question yani we-we talked one on one … when that question time came , eeh you could-you can just raise your hand and then you ask something and they answer so you see through that my interest in Swahili language developed and from there I said " hata mimi mbona nisikuwe kama yeye ? "
So we can conclude that your liking for Kiswahili was majorly initiated by your teacher .
Exactly .
Wow .
Yea , because I had never left the village for ati I ’m going maybe to town , yani that notion that people have that those people who go to town are the ones that know Kiswahili language . Me all through I ’d just been at home .
Rural place .
Yea , like nursery nilikuwa ninaishi tu na wazazi kule tumezaliwa . Being that my father was also just working some few kilometers away from home . I never had any relatives that I could go to visit during the holidays so I used just to go visit my grandmother . Then in primary , that is nursery I was just with my dad . Nurse-primary also just same same place . High school I also learned just a few meters . High school was just a few meters from my-my place where I used to stay . So you see all that through just being at home so hakuna mahali nimeenda ati mara nimeenda ku-hizo mijimiji tuseme kama Mombasa huko kuishi ishi . Sijawai . So ni-nimekua hapa tu nyumbani so my interest imetokana na hao walimu =
Teacher .
Yea the teacher .
The teacher played a very big role .
Exactly .
Okay . And do you think it is important to know your native language ?
That is very important . He ! Native language , you-remember the saying “ mwachamila ni mtumwa ” . He who leaves his cultural values is just more of a slave . So I think knowing the native language is important even though I do n’t have so many things to say about it but I think it ’s very important because first , when someone knows his language-you see you have to know your origin . Yea . Mtu akishajua mahali anatoka , at least you can-it is very easily you can-you can identify that aah this one comes from here . Like I think that matter of mtu kujua origin yake . Kuna movie nilikuwa naona . And you see in that movie there ’s-these Nigerian movies , these common , common Nigerian movies . One that there ’s a man who wanted to marry . So this man loves the lady and you see , now when it reached a moment that now the parents proposed that they want to go and know that lady at least they know where she-the lady comes from , that ’s when the man mm broke it to them that this lady was an orphan , in fact from an orphanage .
The mother gave birth to her , threw her , some good samaritans picked her up kisha wakampeleka hapo kwa orphanage wakakaakaa kakaakaa then when she was old enough now she decided to leave the orphanage and that ’s where they met with that man . So you see , the problem comes in when now this man want to marry the girl . The man has fallen in love with the girl now , but the parents of the man now they are not consenting to that marriage and even the-the villagers , that is the-those people that can call his fathers they are not happy with that because they said how-how do you marry someone without a background ? Mtu ambaye hata hajui kwao ni wapi ? Tuseme ana shida , sasa hizo shida-mnajua when you have a problem and you know [ uncertain transcription ] they can start solving your problem from your history . Let ’s say-let 's say you have a blood pressure . You say “ this blood pressure ametoa wapi ? Kama baba yake hakuwanayo , mama yake hakuwanayo then it means that there ’s someone in your lineage that had this disease " . So you find that it ’s good when a person knows his origin and the same same way it ’s a good when a person knows his lang-native language that ’s when you can also-it 's good when you identify ati " mimi sasa mimi Mjaluo , mi ni Mkisii , mi ni Mkikuyu " . I think it is better that way .
Okay . And do you think .. with the way things are going , because somebody like me I ’ve been brought up in an urban setting . I ’m a Kikuyu but I ’ve been brought up in Rift Valley . Kikuyu , is a problem for me . I can hear but communicating , talking in Kikuyu is very difficult for me . And I ’m not too straight . So do you think now that we have so many like me , those who are brought up in urban areas they do n’t really see the need of our mothertongue . Now that we-we are-we are mixed up . We have Kikuyus , we have Luyas in our area . So we just decide to use Kiswahili or English . Do you think tha t-t hat trend will one day result into our native languages dying ?
Yea =
Language death .
Yea it can result to that , maybe after 100 years . ( she laughs ) . Yea you-so-it ’s not that easy for it but it ’s-there 's a probability that language it can die as a result of that lakini ita-itachukua mda sana . It is going to take a longer time . You see kwanza mimi kwanini nasema mtu lazima ajue lugha yake ? Hao watu ambao wanazaliwa kwa town unajua -they do n’t know the cultural values and whatever the-that is done , whatever is valued as good or whatever is valued as bad with the people back in the village . And that ’s why you find that these people they ’re the ones that after a short time someone , mtu ameingilia sasa hii , aah hii gay . Someone has now decided to become a gay or a lesbian , simply because he does not know-he or she does not know the values , whatever is valued as good or bad by the community . And you see when a person he knows his language , which means he-you know the cultural values , whatever the community upholds or whatever community loves , whatever community th-thinks is good .
When eh-when you know that your language you ’ll know that and you see that ’s why most people it ’s very rare upate mtu ametoka tu akiishi huko kwao kwa kijiji anajua whatever is expected of him or her then ana-anaingilia lesbianism or gayism . You see that one , I think that ’s what is cause-causing this many eh cuz mtu anasema ako digital . How do you become digital if you do n’t even know . You-you see you must start from analogue before you reach digital . So these people that wanachipuka tu ‘ aah mi ni digital ” . Hapana . That ’s now where you see these problems are coming from . So even though it ’s possible that a language should-will also-will one time die , but I-to me I think it ’s not a good thing . People should just strive at least you know your cultural things whatever is expected of you . I think that also promotes , improves your chances of being more digital because when you know more of your things and you know-you know more-more of whatever is expected of you yani unajua the values of your community na pia unajua and they trained us [ uncertain transcription ] I think you become more digital , then just mtu anataka kuwa digital on one side na hataki kujua the other-the other one .
So you think language has a role to play in preserving the culture of-of people ?
Exactly . Yea language has a very big role because from the language you ’ll know what is expected of you because kama tusingekuwa na lugha , hata sisi hatungejua ati eeh nini inafanyika . Eeh . Like tulikuwa tunafundishwa eti like the same same way you see media helps a lot in shaping our role . Because tuseme mtu akizaliwa . Wewe ukizaliwa ulikuwa unajua wewe ni msichana ? Hukujua . So it is through the language that you are taught . Whether it is through the things that you heard that when you come to know that “ oh!’ By the-in fact by the time a person is three years alishajua mimi ni msichana . Because anaona wasichana they put on skirts , that is if you are in the : hu-huko kwa village utajua wasichana put on the skirts , wasichana they mostly stay-stay near their parents or karibu na mama yao . So kama hakuna language there is no way these people will know this . So it is through this language that people get to know who they are . Again it is through the language that umm , whatever is expected is transmitted from one person to the other . [ uncertain transcription ] Kama jamii inakuhitaji uwe mtu wa kiwango hiki utajua kutokana na lugha , that is language . And so language has a very big role in shaping our roles and also in deciding what type of a person you will become .
Okay . Now that you ’ve talked of if you ’re brought up maybe in these rural areas you have a chance to know your language and you can avoid some of these western behaviors like gayism . But recently in the news , we ha-eh-they were talking about Kisumu is leading in homosexuality . Does it mean Kisumu town is a mixture of people , how would you explain that ? Now that Kisumu is … a rural area . We can say-okay it ’s a city but it ’s more of the Luos in-in-in Kisumu . So you would say they know their language . Why ? Why then-why then the-the gayism ?
But you see , eeh that I also heard the report but I never consented to it . I think the-they are just [ uncertain transcription ]
[ uncertain transcription ]
[ uncertain transcription ] But again , you see , mmm the fingers are not the same . Yea . The-why I say the fingers are not the same you find that whether a person knows-yea , mtu anaweza kuwa anajua lugha yake but he knows that this is not expected of me but then mtu atafanya tu . Eeh-the-wanasema mm yani mtu ana- people are just not usually ni kuto-kutotumia tu akili . Hata there 's no language thing in it . It 's people are just now not using their minds . Like it ’s-most people perceive Muslims as people who are the- wanasema ni watu ambao wana : -yani they like killing people . Eeh ukisikia maalshabab watasema hao ni waislamu . Ukisikia sijui watu wanafanya nini utasema ni waislamu but you see , that is not whatever is expected of the Muslims . Yea , kunatu-wanasema-wanasema sisi tunasema kikwetu unajua ukichuwa ndengu na upike , siyo yote yataiva . Eh kuna ile ukikula uta-kuna ile itakuwa inagongagonga meno , eeh ( he laughs , they both laugh ) . So it ’s just the same thing here . Even in the : -you can take that [ uncertain transcription ] community in Kisumu as ndengu . Kisha these that are now doing the wrong thing sasa hiyo ndio ile haikuiva vizuri . ( he laughs )
Okay . It ’s evident that you mix languages as you speak . Why do you think we-we mix languages ? And especially for-for youths ?
Mm , see we youths we like things that are easy . Yea , you see it ’s very difficult to jus t-t o maintain one language . Eh tunataka-yani tunataka njia za mkato ingawa wanasema hizo njia za mkato ni fupi ama njia ya muongo ni fupi , but we like them . Yea , that 's the way-we ’ve just find that ni vitu . Unapenda huwezi zungumza kwani are we white ? We are not wazungu ( they both laugh )
So for convenience and ease [ uncertain transcription ] of speaking =
Yea for the ease of speaking . Lazima tu uta-utakuwa unachangan’ya changya ’nya ndimu hapa na pale because like us , when you ’re given birth tuseme huko huko kijijini cuz me mostly I identify with the kijiji because that ’s where I come from . Aah when you ’re given birth to , first you 've got the language that you-you are- ulisikia hao watu walizungumza ni hiyo lugha-lugha hiyo lugha ya mama . Like me it ’s Dholuo . So you see we first learn things from Dholuo . Unajua-unajua Dholuo hii-hii tuseme meza tutakuwa tunaiita-unaambiwa hii ni meza . So from there ukienda shuleni labda you start introducing another language ... and this becomes maybe Kiswahili or English . They say-say " table " , you see such thing . So it is something that is progressively given to-unto you such that you see but the difference now with the whiteman some mtu anazaliwa akijua lugha yake ni Kiingereza . Maybe hizo lugha zengine ata-atajifundisha akiwa mkuubwa but sisi we-we start learning languages as we grow .
So either anapata mtu ku translate , he knows a little of English , he knows a little Kiswahili and also almost aah three quarters of-of their native language . So there ’s no way mtu atazungumza just kwa lugha moja yet you do n’t have the vocabulary-you do n’t have [ uncertain transcription ] that is lack of vocabulary that is what now constitutes us to speak this other language that is to codeswitch , to change , keep changing from this to the other , this to the other . Like for example let ’s say you ’re describing somebody the fluorescent tube . How would you say that let 's say in Kiswahili ? Eh ? So you can be the [ uncertain transcription ] tuseme " ati Onyango , jana usiku nilipokuwa nikisoma our fluorescent tube ili bust ” ( laughs ) . So unaona ( laughs ) , so lack of the-we do n't have certain words for this . Let ’s say maybe it ’s there but you do n’t know it so that is lack of enough vocabulary it will constitute us now to codeswitch that is to change . Mmm but is not more-mainly for ease of speaking because you should know now-speaking should not stop simply because you do n’t have the correct word you can even describe it =
In another language .
Yea in another language provided the speaker understands you .
Mmm , as long as you can communicate .
Provided you communicate and they can get whatever you ’re saying is , that ’s okay .
Okay so majorly in your conversations , what languages do you tend to mix ?
Uh huuh .
You codeswitch from which languages majorly ?
Maybe Kiswahili , English and Dholuo .
Kiswahili , English , Dholuo .
Yea just tho-those three . Unless =
How about Sheng ?
Yea , Sheng-Sheng mostly but me mostly I-it ’s Kiswahili , English and Dholuo and let ’s say being that I-I really want to know these other-those languages so when I am with them and someone ha-has told me that let ’s say Kikisii . Ku-ku love someone and if when someone tells you “ I love you ” and you say [ speaks another language ] . So if let ’s say I also want to tell this person that I ’m also not that-just that layman [ uncertain transcription ] why not two of the languages that I heard . Yea , but mostly inatoka Kiswahili , English or Dholuo . But kisanasana Sheng pia inaingiaga you see Kiswahlii mostly Sheng utapata Sheng inaingia hapo , lakini sanasana inakuwa Kiswahili , English ama Dholuo .
Okay and have you noted the difference between your mode of speaking the way you speak and the way other students speak ?
Yes . There is a difference . [ uncertain transcription ] whenever I speak they tell me that you , you have a Luo accent . Eeh , wananiambiaga " wewe , when you are speaking English you are speaking with that Luo accent " . And you see I am proud of that because it identifies me that I ’m a Luo . Yea , mimi sio mtumwa . Mi sijaacha mila yetu . Mi bado ni mtu wa huko huko . Eeh ? ( he laughs )
Apart from accent , what other difference in the way we speak ? So that when I ’m inside-when I ’m inside this room , and you ’re outside there , you can almost tell who is speaking in there apart from the accent ?
Mmm apart =
Okay apart from also gender aside , male female you know you can always tell because of the tone , but what else can make you know ? Apart from the accent . Is there-do you think there is any other thing that majorly distinguishes the way we speak ?
Yea , I think there is because-there is . Aah , because you find that there ’s sometimes like let ’s say these people we ’ve known the way they talk . You see tuseme Kibaki anaongea mahali hata mtu asikuambie utasikia tu “ huyo ni Kibaki ” because you see people each and every individual has a special way , has his own different way of speaking . So utapata ni watu wachache sana ambapo mm the way they speak is almost the same . But utapata hutapata ni the same kila mtu ako na upekee fulani jinsi ambavo anatumia lugha .
So that there ’s always that difference like me when our teacher-maybe like just these lectures that we just met within the second semester . Si most lecturers that taught us in Class Seven wengi wao hawajarudi huwa tunafundishwa tu na mmoja ambae alikuwa first sem(semester ) so round hii ni wengine wapya . But even if-let 's say I 'm late for class and I wanted just to determine if the teacher is there I 'd just stand outside there and listen . Then when you hear someone talking you will say “ oh , but I-I thought it was this Mr. Who and who but that voice I 'm getting is not for that mister because each and-each and every individual will have his own peculiar way of saying things . And you see once you know it- ukisha zoeana na wao unajua . Like tuseme sio hata sauti . Mi hata tuseme kuna watu nimezoeana sana they ’re my friends . And if they ’re somewhere and even they ’re not talking I ’ll just know . Eh , I mean there ’s- huwa tunasema kila mtu ako na pia harufu yake . Eeh ? ( he laughs )
The smell .
They are just , they have that smell . Just tell you . Like kuna watu tu , tumezoeana tu nao hii tu-tuli -when we were coming here . Kisha when I ’m in my room then I just sense ( he makes a sniffing/smelling sound ) " Mm , I think that ’s George . George- ndio , George is approaching " . Then , mm just correct to my guess when the door when someone knocks you hear it ’s really George because yani- ee-each and every person has just peculiar ways na uta-utapata the mind imeshajua tu . The brain is just-has just adjusted na imejua “ huyu , huyu mtu anakuja wee anakaa ni Geroge na huyu anakuja ye si George , na huyu maybe ni Laura ” Yea , and you see it ’s the same way with the way people speak .
Mmm so apart from language those are other things that make you notice so and so and not so and so .
Yea exactly .
So you can always tell if somebody is around your area , just like you ’ve said you can almost tell =
Yea , if someone is coming I ’ll just tell and also let ’s say hata back in the villages let ’s say you are walking at night . Sisi tulikuwa tunaambiwa tukitembea usiku na usikie tu na-yani usikie nywele imesimama nini and you are really tense which means hawa watu , hawa wanakimbiagakimbiaga usiku they ’re around . So you just you will know there are some there- yani the body will just sense and tell you " oh ! kuna mtu anakuja " [ uncertain transcription ] . Or tuseme hata like kuna siku nilikuwa nimetoka kwa matanga there ’s a classmate that her parent had died . So nikitoka tulikuwa tumeenda hii tunaita -we call it “ arita ” , that is as-it means when someone is dead na ameshaletwa kutoka kwa mortuary yuko home , now that is the-before that person is buried you see there ’s always people come to : console the family and there ’s some prayers at night . That ’s before the person is buried .
So either tomorrow or the following day huyo mtu anazikwa . Hasa ndio tunaitaga “ arita ” kikwetu . So hiyo day nikitoka hapo , that was just a classmate ’s parent who had died so nikitoka huko tukatoka , tukatoka then when we reach the market center now you see everybody is dispersing to their homes . So mi nikaanza sa naenda . You see ni saa kumi na moja na pia hakukuwa na mwezi . Mwezi ulikuwa umesha zama . So nikaenda nikaenda nikafika sehemu nyingine hapo we always believe that kuna hao watu wakimbiakimbia usiku wakishituashitua watu . They always pass there and you see that saa kumi na moja is the time that ameshatoka kukimbia sasa anarudi kwake . [ uncertain transcription ] saw something . Ilikuwa inasimama and you see huko kwetu they are still that common unaona wanakimbiakimbia maybe hata ma leopard pengine na chui-na chui and hakuna kitu inawafanya .
Yea , so when I saw-when I ss-when I saw something in front of me I said “ oh ! leo ni siku yangu hii kitu imenipata ” So in fact I realized-in fact before I saw it I just realized that at one moment my hair stood still and my body was all numb I could do any-I could n't do anything . So nikasema “ eh ! hii saa nitafanya nini ? ” Nikasema " well " -by-by-by good luck I only had hii kufuli ya baiskeli . Hii watu wanapigaganao baiskeli such that ii-ikuwe safe . That ’s the only thing that I had as my tool . So I said “ this thing is now in my pocket ” so I hold it kisha nikaona ka ile kitu it 's moving . The way ile kufuli ya baiskeli ilitoka kwenye mkono wangu ikaanguka chini . So I could n’t do anything ! ( he laughs ) . So nikaona [ uncertain transcription ] inaendaenda and it went- mimi nilikuwa nimesimama tu . Hakuna kitunilifanya sasa nilisema kama ni kunimaliza let it come and finish me . ( he laughs heartily ) . So it just went that way so you see apart from language there ’s also those other ways that unaweza jua that something is not amiss-something is amiss somewhere .
Yea . Okay and when somebody talks can you tell their level of education . You know when somebody talks you : can tell their level of education , maybe their position in society , maybe their political affiliation . Can you always tell ?
You can .
How ?
You see when a person talks fast for you-from the vocabulary then this person is-like uh-when I finished school I was the secretary of another group . Yani we formed a village group so I was the secretary so I used to take the minutes . So you see when we go for the-for our meetings there was this person , alikuwa anajichukua eti amesomasoma so he knows English but each and every time he : -we want to speak , say that “ I want to spoke something here ” So ! ( he laughs ) So he says that same thing for quite a number of times such that I got interested and I went-went and asked my man “ eti huyu mtu , mtu na-huyu mtu huwa tukonaye kwa kikundi chetu alisomaga hadi class ? ” . Si akaniambia huyu mtu alisomaga hadi Class Four . So yet in our group he just used to say “ I-I-I want to spoke something here , you are not-you are not to gotten me ” . So you see I used to laugh so from there I went and asked my man then from there ndio nikagundua kumbe mtu alikuwa anatudanganya eti alisoma Kisumu Boys . Kumbe hata hakusomea Kisumu Boys . So from the way-the vocabulary there-that this person uses , utajua eti huyu mtu amesoma hadi kiwango kipi . Kisha again you see there are certain things that eeh is accepted naturally and tha t-t hat way-that ’s good . For example kutumia hii inaitwaje , this using a language that has some form of this[uncertain transcription ] sijui how do you call it in English . So unajua utumizi wa tafsida mtu akienda shule atajua ati badala ya kusema “ mwanamke , mwanamke yule amezaa ” at least it ’s better mtu aseme " amejifungua " .
Ameji [ uncertain transcription ]
Yea so you see , oo-these people that did never went to school whenever they talk you can just get from the type of words that they use . Then again there ’s the : -aa-the-let ’s say the : political parties [ uncertain transcription ] you can not associate from how learned that person is because depending-because in politics the matter is just persuasion . How-how ma-how well you can move the masses . That is the numbers . That 's why now Mutahi Ngunyi came with the what the numbers . Tyranny of numbers . You see if you do n’t have that language how will you communicate with these people ? So you see that some people they ’re more-they ’re well speakers . Yea . Tunaita walumbi kwa kiswahili , ambao wanauwezo sana waku-yani mtu hata akikuongelesha akikwambia kitu unaona this person is telling me the right thing .
Orators .
Yea , the-the orators . And those that have the ability to convince people . So you see , we have those people and it ’s also just that ’s the rule that you can also it can help you lie for example the way [ can n't ascertain name of person mentioned ] speaks , if someone tells you will only land up to Class Eight will you accept that ? Because by the time I was in Class Eight I could n’t even speak ( he laughs ) maybe one over eight of what he could s o-o f what he ’s speaking so-which means the type of-the language that a person speaks will a-will tell you so many things about that person . Kama ni mtu amesoma ama hakusoma , kama-na hata kama alisoma alisoma hadi kiwango kipi . Eeh , so you can really learn a lot from the way a person speaks .
So langauge is a very important determinant .
Exactly . In fact , without-there ’s a teacher who used to tell us that there ’s power in the language . And there ’s that-a very-there ’s power because mmekutana na demu ama charlie yako , kama hauna language how will you come to terms ? You cannot . You- mmekutana na-na mama ako let ’s say- hasa tuache hata hapo sana -there ’s something you want from someone without the language how will you speak ? Unless you are the someone who is dumb , cannot talk . Even they have their signs and that is also-signing those are also forms of communication which means that is also their language through which they speak . So , I think languages-language is a very powerful tool . There ’s power in that language .
So still through that language you can be able to tell somebody ’s position in society . By position I mean you know those ranks . How can you always tell ?
Umm . With using the language .
Mmm .
You can tell but you see languages , I think no-not so- sio-sio kwa kiwango kikubwa . Eh because tunapata mostly- tunapata wa-hawa watu ambao pia wako na pesa wanakuaga penda madharau kidogo . Unajuwa hawapendagi kuongea sana . Eeh . So , you see mostly these people that the-they are really wealthy in the society they rarely talk and you see through that you can also say , eh let ’s say uko na mtu unaona ye huwa haongei sana . eh ? He would say “ I only speak if I have what to say . If I do n’t have why should I speak ? ” eh ? ( he laughs ) . And so you see eeh those people , it ’s true also use of that language you see there are certain people in the society that ’s they rarely talk for real . Sijui wanaogopa watalogwa wakiongeaongea sana au nini ? So una-ukiona mtu huwa ako tu hapo huwa haongeingei sana . So just such-such people kujua mind yao inakuwa ngumu . It becomes very difficult . So you cannot say this person . And this our society they have people who are social who can talk to another so which means language can be used to glue people again . And , hmm . Yea . Cuz like me I talk a lot . So they say " Okwello always talks even if he does n’t have anything to say " . ( he laughs )
He will always talk .
Eh , he always talks . Then you will find that they ’ll say that this other person in our class , yeye huwa haamki hata kama mwalimu ameeleza kitu na amejua kuwa haongei kisha hadi mfikirie ati hajui but exams zikikuja si mtaona matokeo . Yea , so language you can also use it to glue people and depending on how a persons speaks and-oh yea depending on how a person speaks unaweza ukatumia that language at least kujua =
So that way you have these wealthy people and they have a high level of education , which language do they tend to speak ?
That ’s English .
English ?
Yea in fact the-the-before they employ people even to their nanny , that is the maid . Oh they-you must ensure that you will be speaking English to their children .
So I think the western influence does a lot so that when you hear somebody speaking English you assume they ’re of a high status , they ’re wealthy , they have a high level of education so that you place English at a higher level than Kiswahili and these other languages .
But that was in the olden days during-during the colonial era . That ’s when they took English to be a very : - yani ile-yani lugha ambayo inahadhi it has more status then the other one . But nowadays I-I do n’t think that ’s true .
Do you think so ?
That 's not true .
Okay . It may not be true but if you go to an office today , and you are told you-and one of you speaks in English . Another one speaks in Kiswahili , another one starts to use their native language . Not that they can tell " no this person we speak the same language " . Among the three who do you think will be taken to be serious ?
Ah maybe the person that used his English but he stood out because of that stereotype .
The stereotypes .
Yea that is stereotyping you see , mtu -because tho-those are the old-the-the old ideas . Yea so someone knows that this-this person can speak English then he 's more knowledgable then this one the one who can speak in Kiswahili which is always not the case . I think it ’s just a matter of stereotypes . Yea , the olden ideas zilishakuja kwa akili yetu zikakaakaa huko . Thus that kuzitoa we need another 50 years , plus that . Those-those old-old ideas can be erased from your mind but you see , those are the ways of the world . It is very difficult to change them . How I could change them . ( both laugh )
Okay . Yea , ahh that could be true because like in our constitution it says Kiswahili is a national language and it ’s an official language . In fact it ’s-it ’s like the status in the constitution is even higher than that of English . But , rarely in offices and any formal context would you find people ever speaking in Kiswahili . We always speak in English . The medium of instruction in schools is { always English } , apart from Kiswahili lessons .
{ Always English } Kiswahili . They only say during Kiswahili lessons but now I think people should just change . But it will take time haitakuwa raisi but at the end I think it will just change .
Okay . You said you speak different languages to different people . Can you say the reasons again ?
The reasons , you see the reason as to why we speak is just to-for communication , see ? And for communication to be effective there must be feedback . Let ’s say I know you do n’t know Dholuo . Yea , so let ’s say I ’m speaking to you in Dholuo . You see , maybe you might just be seeing my lips moving and getting whatever I ’m saying you might take me to be a singer that now I ’m singing or maybe someone who is possessed with the holy spirit speaking in other language . Maybe it ’s my-just my Dholuo . So you see , why I chose different languages to different it ’s just as a matter of effective communication . Such that nikis-ongea na wewe at least unipate nikupate , kwahivyo mawasiliano ndio yaweze ku : kuendelea mbele . Like lately I ’m speaking to my mom , my mom does n’t know a lot of English .
So if I decide to use English , which means I want to say eh-eh translate , then let her now tell me [ uncertain transcription ] in fact I tell her what to tell me in English [ uncertain transcription ] aniambie , so that will be-that will take a century . So it depends on who I am talking with but now whether I want that my message to be reached . Let ’s say tunasengenya mtu . Najua in our [ uncertain transcription ] there ’s someone let 's say from [ uncertain transcription ] community who does not know Dholuo na hatutaki asikie . Ya nini tuseme kitu ataisikia ? So it means we ’ll just be speaking Kiswahili Kiswahili then hapo in between we codeswitch . We change now-we now start speaking Dholuo . We say in fact two three Dholuos [ uncertain transcription ] before agundue we ’ve again turned back so , ( he laughs ) Maybe ili kuficha pia siri zetu yea , kuna kitu hutaki mtu asikie .
So you can also use that and another just as I said for convenience . Ili at least muelewane kwa urahisi lazima tu itabidi mtumie hiyo . But you see again some other times when I find that I-let ’s say you find that you are speaking with your friends then at least-you are so many who is there like mostly few Luos maybe you aah-you want to say something but kisha mlikuwa mnazung-mnazungumza kwa Kiswahili then you ’ll change to Dholuo even for just one minute . You find that the person that you are with huwa wana kasirika . Na hata sijui ni kwanini . Sasa-yani wanachukua tu ati mnawasengenya . Hata kama you are not , you- hata hamuwasengenyi yani mmezoeazoea tu ati sisi tukizungumza there are certain things that maybe you do n’t have that word in-in Dholuo-in maybe in Swahili you just have it in Dholuo . So ukisema hiyo mnajua hawo watu huwa wana kasirika sana . So ukishajua pia niko na watu kama hawa itabidi sasa u : situmie hiyo English-I mean usitumie hiyo lugha yako ya Ki-eeh-ki-kinyumbani yani kwasababu ni hawa watakasirika .
So at the end of the day it ’s for effective communication and everybody 's becomes comfortable with the way you are speaking .
Yea , exactly . Cuz unajua all of us we-we want to be viewed as good people . Sasa yani who likes creating enemies . And if you know that if eeh I do this itafanya mtu akasirike sasa kwanini ufanye ? Itabidi sasa uzungumze kwa ile lugha ambayo huyo mtu anaelewa .
So have you ever tried to change the way you speak ?
( Pause ) Mmm …
Your way of speaking . Anything about the way you talk maybe one day you talked and somebody told you “ oh noo . I think you-you are talking Luo English , can you please adjust ? ” ( he laughs ) . Has that ever bothered you ?
Yea , yea that-I think that that has really-that has bothered me so much like-like let 's say when you are in high school . You see in high school we-we loved so much jokes such that we could change let ’s say-yani we used to translate things in Dholuo . Like let ’s say mm .. mm-maybe there are these-these certain [ uncertain transcription ] that mtu you know them but you-being that hutaki tu kuzisema you just want to-you want to translate them in-in Dholuo . So unapata .. kuna watu huwa wanakasirika eh na anakwambia ati wewe hapana usifanye [ uncertain transcription ] in the assembly , the-the head teacher could come assembly and say that “ Okello , you are very notorious of speaking EngLuo here " ( he laughs ) . Like tuseme mm-like there are these common terms , where let ’s say : - let me think of one .
There are some certain common terms that differen t-t hat people use and you see when you look at their translation like let ’s say mtu -someone they want to marry . You say that “ my sister ameenda kupika ” . You see mostly sisi kwetu tuna ku-sasa ku marry- mtu kwenda kuolewa ni-yani Dholuo tunasema ameenda kuteedo . Yani sasa hiyo “ teedo " ni kupika . So na ulikuwa unasema when someone else goes “ nowadays I have not seen your sister for so long ” . Say “ that one ? That want went to marry-went to cook a long time ago ” . So- ( he laughs ) so you find that the teachers they were not happy with that . They get pissed off and they come in the same day and beaten .
And also everyone here on campus there are some people that said " eh that you , that your Luo accent it-I really hate it " . In fact when you are speaking their friends say-[uncertain transcription ] just eavesdrop in certain people ’s conversation that la-especially ladies , hear them say “ aah , ati mi huwa nakuwa pissed off nikipata Charlie ako na hiyo accent ya kikwao ati for real ” . ( he laughs ) . So I realize that there are some people that that does n't bother them . But unapata most people , especially hata mtu anang ’oa ( he laughs ) . Kama “ kula ” mtu atasema maybe “ kura ” so people really get pissed off and you see this stuff yani nikulingana na mahali mtu ametoka ama ile sehemu umekuwa . Ama sehemu umekaa sana . So there are people that really hate to bother with that .
Okay , do you think there are some specific reasons that make people get bothered with the-with your tone because as you said and it ’s all about effective communcation . As long as I can communicate with you regardless of my tone . Eeh should it really bother you ? What are some of the reasons you think make people get =
Pissed off .
Bothered .
Aah , you see when a person says for example “ kula ” instead of “ kura ” ama eeh mtu-watu mmeenda kupiga kura ye [ uncertain transcription ] mtu aseme “ huyu ile siku si tuliamka tukaenda kupiga kula ” ( he laughs ) . So-so you think eeh , maybe whatever you wanted- what may piss those people off is that whatever you wanted them to get he does not get it in the correct way . And they do n’t get it in the way that you wanted it to be : - tuseme you meant “ kula ” ye akasikia “ kura ” . Mm ? Ye akasikia " kura " sasa unaona kuna then unapata watu wanakasirika kwasababu hawapati the-your information correctly . I think that is one of the reasons . But again some of our people are just too petty . If you-if somebody knows that instead of saying-instead of saying “ kula ” I say “ kura ” and people understood that that is my way of speaking why should they now get to be bothered and they know that 's how I do it ? So some people are just too petty . Like you see mostly we ’ll say now for me eti-these people the-being petty is always assocated with women . They 'll say when a women is pregnant they say ” oh my neck ” sijui nininini . Hata kama hakuna kitu na leg . These people that make they get pissed off sio ninii , they understand but they- sijui ni nini they are just becoming too petty . Hawana shida . Ni just ni mtu petty na wanapenda tu kusumbuasumbua but hawana shida yoyote .
Mm hmm . And eh , there is no way you can-do you think you can change the way you talk ?
Yes .
Now can you get rid of the Luo accent at this stage ?
This stage ( he laughs )
Can you say now from today , I ’m not speaking English with Luo accent ? From now ?
It ’s-it can change but you see it ’s a matter of practice . Mm cuz they say practice makes perfect but even some people you can remove them from the village but you cannot remove the village out of them . So ( he laughs heartily ) . Unaweza ukasema ukaamua na useme-hata mimi kuna nyakati nilikuwa nimesema kuna wakati wa information week with Alex [ uncertain about last name ] alikuwa amekuja huku kwetu . So when he came alituongelesha alituongelesha kisha kuna mtu alikuwa sasa MC alikuwa ni boy fulani huwa ni 4th year hapa [ uncertain transcription ] hapa shuleni kwetu hapa , yes . So aki-mwenyewe mtu alikuwa anazungumza anasimama anasema Kiswahili and nimekuwa nimesema “ aah hapo sasa , hapo ndipo ” . [ uncertain transcription ] anaongea kila kitu . Something new and me I do n’t know what information science is in Kiswahili na yeye alikuwa anasema sijui kitivo cha nininini , [ uncertain transcription ] ( he laughs ) .
So kulingana na jinsi ambavyo alikuwa anasema hata mimi nilikuwa nimesema sitaongea Kiswahili-ah sitaongea Kiingereza the whole day . Hata hikuchukua thirty minutes ( he laughs ) but I know with practice-mm because huwa a person speaks mostly in their environment . Let 's say we change in your environment . Yea , tuseme sasa mtu atoke hapa huende mahali ambapo ile lugha inazungumzwa . Tuseme ni Kiswahili peke hakuna lugha nyingine ambapo tena inazungumzwa pale . So you find that with time you ’ll also change your way of speaking . Just like mtu atoke hapa aenda kusoma huko Marekani . Akae-akae huko let ’s say for hata over ten years . Unajua wakati sasa mtu anarudi at least the- jinsi ambavyo alikuwa anatumia lugha itakuwa imebadilika na jinsi ambavyo atakuwa anaitumia wakati kama huu . Like we used to be told kuna -there ’s some presenter who went out in America . I think he stayed there for nine years . When he came back now he had developed that the American accent of speaking but I think that was for-that piece was forced . I think nine-nine years does not qualify you to-now to change your accent the way you speak and now you want to imitate the way they do it . But some people do it . But to me I think it should even be over 25 years that 's when now I will get some other people ’s accent . ( he laughs )
So the environment will determine =
the environment
because the environment will dictate to you what language you will use . So with the time instead of using the Dholuo noun shift you ’ll switch it to English and with time that accent =
That accent now unapata ile accent ya Kiluo , na ile accent ya Kiluo sasa inaisha [ uncertain transcription ] kwasababu hapa watu this article that you are not [ uncertain transcription ] but here in campus you see it ’s very difficult . Because let ’s say like a room , all we are-all of us are Luos . When I go to class , three quarters of us are Luos there in our class . When I go to choir in the middle of the choir , you ’ll find that almost a quarter of those people there are Luos . So there are just Luos , Luos , Luos everywhere so that ile ni change I 'll say that from today I want to change , it ’s going to be very difficult because my environment the people that are near me ni wa Luo . Na kila wakati tukikuwanajaa hakuna disc kama ile za high school .
At least kama ile system ya high school ingekuwa hapa at least that ingesaidia kidogo . Because in high school ama primary kama ungepatikana unaongea Kijaluo hiyo ingekuwa ni kiboko ile mbaya mbovu . Lakini sasa hapo ukikuja hapa provided you communicate hata there ’s no [ uncertain transcription ] about that . In fact there ’s association-associations quite a number , ukienda utasikia sijui there Kinyumusa , that is Kisumu district sijui what association , kuna hii ya Waluya . So you find that in all these things-these meetings that they attend them , the language that they speak there is again Luo . In class you have Luos , in room you have Luos so it ’s very difficult mtu abadilike ama a change jinsi ambavyo anatumia lugha ingekuwa ngumu .
You ’ve talked about-what you ’re saying is reinforcement . That is reinforcement in high school . But now negative , that is negative reinforcement where you ’d be beaten if you speak =
Yea , if you speak , they ’ll beat you .
If you speak Luo in-in school =
Yea they beat you .
So you think enforcement plays a big role .
Yea it plays a big role . Yea because umm , let ’s say in high school-let ’s say mi nikitoka -in fact the incident that I remember I was in Class Four . That was my first time cuz eeh , from my Class One to Class Three I was in another school and my dad would put up a home somewhere . So I had to transfer to that school that was nearest to our home . So when I reached there I think it was my second day in that school , it was on a Tuesday so we went now . And each and every evening they used to provide disc , I do n’t know whether you know what a disc is . There are those wooden things they give you if you speak Dholuo , yani if you speak your native language you are given . So there ’s a lady alikuwa ananionea tu -she knew that I never-in fact by then I never knew any Kiswahili or any English cuz primary , nursery ni Dholuo mtakuwa mnafundishwa in Dholuo . Mkifika Class One no English something , Kiswahili but everything Dholuo . Sasa watakuwa wanasema aah let 's say they were-they 're teaching you about uuuh , tuseme hata-aah-tuseme hata " kikombe " . They ’ll tell you what that kikombe is in your mother tongue . That hii nyii mnaita " okombe " , then in Kiswahili tunaita " kikombe " , then in English you call that “ cup ” . So they start in Dholuo then you see if you want to teach someone you start from what that person knows . Yea , from known to unknown . Huwezi anzia upa known ulikuja known .
So walikuwa wanatuanzisha na Dholuo . So in fact hata Dholuo we used to be taught it . From Class One to Class Three mnafundishwa Dholuo . So-like-the in short that we knew Dholuo . So- na hata uko Class One to Three you spoke in that Dholuo hakuna kitu mli-ngefanyiwa . They expected you still to-because that Dholuo you ’re being taught as a subject , ilikuaga . So when we reach Class Four mi sasa hapo nilikuwa nimezowea Dholuo . Eh kisha tulikaa Class Four mnasikia kuna disc . It ’s a different school pia . New friends and nobody knows you there . You 're the-your second day . So demu fulani akaniita . So yeye aliitwa ati- the last person which has that disc ndio anaenda huko mbele . Kisha unaita who gave it to you . Kisha huyo dame akanita eeh tha t-t ha t-t hat sequence . So I asked just in Dholuo " ati ( says sentence in Dholuo ? ) And- ati “ whom did you give the disc ? ” ( he laughs heartily ) Ooh now they say you see now ? Mwalimu was saying ulikuwa una harass unaona ameenda amezungumza Dholuo pale ? So nikaletwa huko mbele ati “ we una-we una-we ni kichwa gumu sana unazungumza Dholuo kwa assembly ” So see I just had to keep quiet and they beat me beat me alot . Yea , walinipigapiga . But I learnt my lesson .
And now , now I used to not to speak [ uncertain transcription ] now at least I had started knowing a little , a little . So mtu anasema “ twende tucheze ” sababu wewe utakua unasema " twenda tucheze " . [ uncertain transcription ] Because [ uncertain transcription ] . ( he laughs ) . So in the end at least-but I think it also helped me . That disc hata it helped me because now I used to also-to style because it ’s very painful we kuwa na kila evening unatwangwatwangwa unatwangwatwangwa eti umesema Dholuo . So nilikuwa na -so sikuwa naongea mostly . Just keep quiet . But when I reached Class Five I think now-now I could ask someone akiomba maandazi “ basi unipatie maandazi , nipe maandazi ” You ’d still be-you ’re still not that fluent so I think ilikuwa inasaidia . This-this reinforcement idea unakuta tu usiongee hiyo lugha because unajua ukirudi home , ni Dholuo . Anywhere you go it ’s just Dholuo so at least whenever they ’re using those reinforcement at least ilikuwa inatusaidia . Yea , so I think hiyo pia ni njia moja wapo ambayo ilikuwa inasaidia katika kukuza lugha kama matumizi ya hizi lugha geni Kiswahili na Kiingereza .
Mm . From what you have said I ’ve realized one thing . You say in the rural areas , it ’s preventing you from talking in mother tongue . And in the urban areas it ’s preventing you-it ’s all about preventing you from talking in … in Kiswahili . So there is a disc , but a disc for those who will talk in Kiswahili .
Yea .
So that it 's only English . And from the rural areas there ’s a disc for those who will talk in ? { native language }
{ Native language }
So do you think this system of education is-is really fair ? I think then there should be some measure so that those children in rural areas and those in urban areas be put in the same environment because you do the same exam that ’s why in performance of languages in most of these rural areas you ’ll find that they really perform very poorly . Apart from specific schools . But now when you come to the urban areas they do n’t have a problem with the English , which would be the medium of the-of-of eeeh-the medium that they ’ve been using , answering the questions in exams , they are okay with it . But now when you go to the rural areas they have a problem and yet you write the same exam .
Yes . And now that ’s now the way the system now has really been putting in a challenge . Because you are-for example whatever you ’d say I have a classmate when I was telling her that we used to be taught mother tongue alikuwa anacheka ati “ nyi mnafundishwa mother tongue [ uncertain transcription ] primary ” And so nilikuwa namwambia si Class One to Three ni mother tongue unafundishwa and it ’s just a subject they bring to you eti connect these words , the compounds , this compound things in English . When you connect words . They were also doing them to us but when you take [ says a Luo word ] plus [ speaks in Luo ] it becomes [ another Luo word ] is now the giraffe . So you see that ’s how we call it . So that giraffe in Dholuo , it has a compound name so you see , those are the things they used to bring to us . So-and I told her ati sisi tulikuwa tunapewa disc tukizungumza mother tongue . So alikuwa ananiambia wao wanapewa disc wakizungumza Kiswahili , ye alikuwa anatoka Mombasa .
So you see I was also wondering “ Wow ! ” ( he laughs ) “ Why is it that we when we speak in mother tongue we are given a disc ? So but she told me that to them that Swahili is now like their mothertongue . So unajua hawataki . So pia inalingana na ile sehemu mtu anatoka cuz they fear in those urban areas they know Swahili is most the language that you speak there so at least wanataka at least we pia ujue-muwe na lugha nyingine . Tofauti apart from this Kiswhaili . But I think that is really a very big problem . But hata unaona when results zilipotoka . We passed Kiswahili more then these people . Eh . So you see , we also passed that like-you see now there ’s Kisumu in those our areas you find people pass Swahili then these people that they- watu whatever they always speak Kiswahili , those people they beat us in spoken Kiswahili but we beat them in written Swahili . Yea so I think [ uncertain transcription ] hakuna shida . Wacha tu ye aongee na hiyo maongezi yake nione itampeleka na acha mi niandike na nipite . ( he laughs )
I think that 's where Sheng comes in .
Yea exactly .
You know now the problem with urban areas nowadays it is the Sheng . So that even in the-the-their writing the Kiswahili , they are writing Kiswahili Sheng .
Yea . Si wanaongezaongeza hizo Sheng .
Yea . That ’s now the problems are different . So for them they ’re affected by the Sheng that ’s why then in written it becomes a problem .
Inakuwa shida sana .
What are some of the issues you speak with your friends , nowadays ?
Ooh that 's so nice . With my friends , kwanza mostly-you see pia inalingana which friends do I have like let ’s say most in our room , when we speak I have friends who like ball . Si unajua tukiwa pale pamoja tulikuwa tunazungumzia " Oh arsenal wanas " - kama [ uncertain transcription ] amefanyiwa nini , then again when the-now let ’s say you have some other friends that those that too intimate that you are close to . Sasa unajua utazungumza k-unaona demu fulani mahali wewe , eh ? ( he laughs ) So you also speak so many things .
Like again in our room we also have a brother who is saved so most utapata ye akikuja room atakuwa anatuongelesha kuhusu uokovu ati nyinyi we are saved , the lord is coming and even though you oppose it , sometimes you question you question and you see when you start questioning he stops and he gets angry na anatoka njee . ( he laughs heartily ) . So mostly , mostly si kuwa tuanona mostly medium like me , me sometimes I like speaking about politics . Mimi napenda siasa . I-I defend [ uncertain transcription ] that is nikisikia someone has negative attitudes towards him I always [ uncertain transcription ] now to give me your views , why do you think he is not the right man ? Kisha akaniambia [ uncertain transcription ] nimwambie zangu then we see . But we never come to terms , I always walk out . ( he laughs heartily ) Because when it ’s too much- kama nikiona ni too much sasa siwezi sitaki mimi huwa natoka .
Mmm , unatoka . What about female friends ?
Now the female friends =
Cuz I think sometimes there ’s always additions so what do you think when you talk with your male friends and female friends ?
Yea , the female friends now it depends on the level of intimacy now between me and the lady . Like for example me I ’m a person-so I 'm a person who does not believe in love , so : huwa na-nawaambiaambia unajua some-mostly by the way huwa wananikwijia wananiambia “ unasemaga hu believe in love lakini Charlie yangu sijui nini -so mostly huwa na : -I just talk to them-I just talk to them . Yea let 's say-but with the ladies I mostly talk of relationship issues . Eh mnajuwa wanakuja wananiambia . Yani unajua mimi I was heartbroken several times in love such that siku hizi I do n’t believe in love . Love is just fantastical it does not exist . Ni fantasy tu .
Just humans relation . So unajua ananiambia “ ulikuwa unasema hapa huyu demu alikufanyaga -what did you do ? How did you- yani how did you recover ? ” Namwambia “ ooh , these people . These are people who got me with my teeth . When they had grown . I also found them with their teeth , when they had grown . Which means they are only trying to supplement my life and when they walk out of my life I also walk out of their lives and ina-inaishia hapo . Sasa whatever I tell them mostly inafanya relationship unapata mtu anakwambia Charlie yake amemboot amempata Charlie yake na dame anataka wewe sasa umsaidie ama uwende uongee na huyo Charlie wake . Namwambia but hata nikiongea na yeye the most important thing ni you . Cuz it ’s your love life not mine . Eh , so mostly with ladies me I speak about relationships things . Mambo ya mapenzi . Ndio sisi huongea sana na wasichana .
Mmm , why do you think it ’s that way ?
Sijui , you see-(he laughs ) I do n’t know but I think it ’s just that way because let ’s say when I was in high school . In fact mimi most of my friends are always ladies . Yea . Mostly . Hata s-hapa hapa campus , most of my friends hata ukiangalia ati I have let ’s say if I have ten friends . You ’ll find that six of them are ladies .
Law of opposites .
Yes . ( laughs ) Like forces attract and sijui what what repel . Cuz unapata mostly kwanza hata mi nikiwa home my best friend is my mom . ( loud noises make recording momentarily inaudible ) So you find that me most of my-most of the Luo that I associate with this they are in fact hata hatusemi nilipokuwa high school yani in our family it ’s me that I ’ve stayed with my mom for the longest time cuz when you-in our family we are three . So ile time tukizaliwa my mom and dad [ uncertain transcription ] so she had to go away so we had to remain with my father ’s sister na [ uncertain transcription ] Kisha when she came back my brother left when my brother ’s in Class One , I think by then nilikuwa nursery . Brother akaenda kuishi na my nyanya . So tukabaki mimi na huyo sister wangu na my mom . Kisha tukakaa tukakaa . When my sister also reached Class Four she also left and went and stayed with my grandmother . So it ’s just me , from nursery to now the moment I was coming to campus . That ’s when I got separated with my mom . So I always find that the ladies are the people you can always talk to . That ’s why unawapata hata high school most of my friends they were my-they were ladies . Uuh , si-even here , I have more-more female friends then men . ( he laughs ) . Eh , because we get along together eeh .
Now that you do n’t believe in love , what will happen when you want to have a family ? Now that you do n’t believe in love ? What will happen ?
That is now , that ’s always my main worry but you see , I always say that when such things reach that I will take at that moment . It ’s like the last time I went to the city , that person that was conducting the test asked me that should we find you positive what will you do ? I told if you find me positive I ’ll take a decision in that moment . The thing is the same , same way . If I think now I should have a family the decision will come at that moment .
So you ’ll cross the bridge when you get there .
Yea .
Mm , okay . That ’s interesting . Do you think because you talk abou t-t o ladies on issues of relationships , does culture have anything to do with that so that with culture you only find that with the ladies you can only talk about relationships . You can n't talk about anything else . Maybe issues about-okay you can say politics maybe they do n’t like but any other issues ?
You see first ladies mimi wasichana na kwambia ni watu nimekaa nao sana . So ladies when they ’re there in fact [ uncertain transcription ] speaking-let ’s say I ’m all over-I 'm in the midst of ladies and I am not speaking they are the ones that are talking mostly they never talk of anything constructive . Hapa anakwambia “ Charlie yangu hivi Charlie yanguhivi ” Like upset . [ uncertain transcription ] nilikuwa -I was more to the ladies then the men in fact my roommate started complaining that sijui nimewekewa nini sijui nimeweka dawa nimewachukia . But you see when I was with those ladies I learned that there ’s no time when two ladies are together that they propose “ eti akija Keith tusome ” hakuna ! Nilikua naona tulikuja anakwambia “ jana unajua tulikuwa tunafanya nini ? Tulikuwa tunagombana na Charlie yangu ’ So anamwambia “ wewe hukubalii hki , atakuona we ni cheap ” . So ( he laughs ) there ’s no single time mimi in my life that ladies I would see ladies talk about anything constructive . So they say if you cannot beat them you join them . Me as a pers-as a single persons I cannot tell them " okay do change whatever you ’re speaking let ’s speak about this " . Ahh if you find these people are speaking about-they ’re talking about relationships like they always talk about their Charlies-their what . If you want to be their friends , speak whatever they like . Mmm .
You fit there .
Yea , you just fit there because you cannot beat them so you simply join them . Eh , cuz me that ’s our-what I ’ve know for . Hutapata msichana anazungumza anything constructive In fact during those days we had we had assignments so nikiwaambia ati ona nyinyi mnaongeaongea hapa kwanzia wakati ule hata hakuna mmoja ame suggest tufanye ile kazi ya chamoroko . Hata hakuna mtu anasema tuseme nikawa nawaambia let us now do this . Sasa ukisema hivyo na this anasema ‘ haki yako now umebonga ’ ati this story tutaendeleza baadaye ( he laughs ) . So mostly unaendapata you-for you to be friends with people , you do what appeals to them . And you see , that ’s why the Kenyan poli-the Kenyan politicians , they are really misusing us . Cuz the Kenyans know that we like-we-they know what we like to hear . Mtu akishajua “ huyu mtu huwa anapenda kusikia hili na hili na hili .
Then it ’s-then for me to be that person’s friend I have to pretend-to do whatever that person likes . The MPs knows that we do n’t like the truth . So they will come with the lies , tell us , we accept , we vote for them . Yea , but it ’s the same same way even in high school you see I have-I had so many friends in high school . But in high school they were not so many of ladies but I know I had so many-I had men friends like I knew that when I had-when I ’m with person ‘ x ’ , this person ‘ X ’ loves football . Let me tell him something about football so as to maintain our friendship . Nilikuwa na person ‘ Y ’ , this person ‘ Y ’ likes-likes-likes banana . He loves [ uncertain transcription ] So if I know that my friends likes that when I ’m with him I just say that . Because I do n’t want to terminate our friendship maybe there ’s something I ’m getting from the friendship there ( he laughs ) . Yea .
So generally from what we have talked about it then-eeh , seems language is very important .
Language is very important .
Do you think there can ever be life without language ?
Mmm , life without language . So tricky . ( laughs ) . But uhhh , I think life can just be there . But now life will be there but haitakuwa that successful cuz sasa mtakuwa mnawasilianaje ? Tuseme cuz it ’s just like life is not complete in itself . Kuna vitu mtu wa- unaweza kuwa na hii na hii nyingine huna . So , it ’s really tough life without language and that way-when you see when you are now studying , the- venye language ilikuja kuna nadharia tatu , I think they are three . I do n't them [ uncertain transcription ] There ’s one that says that language came from God . Mmm . That is according to the Is-the Muslims and the Christians they agree that language came from God . Even though that one it also has some shortcomings , that if language came from God why does the-those-the are people who does not believe in God you see and these people also talk . They have a language so therefore where did the language come from .
Yea , then another shortcoming of tha t-t hat say that language came from God is that there are these people that cannot talk the dumb people . If the language came from God then why did n’t God give them ? So you see ( laughs ) the thing that states-states that where language came from ilikuwa insema eti language in the olden days human beings used to stay in the forest . So in those forests according to what the things that were surrounding them-they 're birds-like you see the birds and the chicken they were staying with them so after a certain duration of time these people decided to leave and now go back to - wale wametoa waliaumua kutoka msituni warudi huko sasa mahali wanaishi . Kisha waliporudi wali took with them certain sounds like-for example they say that the word ‘ cock ’ whenever they heard that cock used to maybe to make those aah , ’ kokoriokoo ’ so cock . So they decided that his name now comes from there so ( he laughs ) , so there are so many ways that they say that language came about . But I think language you-you-without life is quite difficult . Mmm , cuz language is very important in our day to day communications , lazima uongee .
You have to talk .
Eeh you have to talk with people . So without language kumbe inakuwa ngumu . You cannot say that without language there can n't be life cuz there are people uuuh-the-let ’s say the birds . From the animals . See they have a differen t-t hey have a way in which they communicate . They also have their way-their own ways of communications even though they are not humanity bado maisha yanaendelea tu .
Now that you have said those people who are Christians , and those who are Muslims where do you fall ?
Mimi ?
Mmm .
Eh mi as a person I ’m a Christian .
Oh you ’re a Christian .
I ’m a Christian .
Okay . And eehh , generally what can you comment about language patterns ?
Mmm
By language patterns I mean how people use language generally on campus ? Everywhere . Here , in stage , everywhere .
Mmm , the language pattern it ’s different . Again , different in [ uncertain transcription ] different types of people . Like here tunapata tupo someone who cannot construct a complete sentence in Swahili [ uncertain transcription ] mnajua , the most the ironical part of it this person is taking a bachelors sijui of education in Swahili . So mtu anafanya Swahili na Historia na mtu hawezi akasema sentensi moja iliyo kamilifu na ile ambayo iko sahihi kimaana , kwa kiswahili . Si unajua anashindwa-yani ni mtu ile ya hatari ya Sheng . Ni Sheng imeingilia mtu hadi kwa damu . Kwa [ uncertain transcription ] mtu tu ni Sheng .
Okay so Sheng interferes and Sheng =
Sheng has really interfered a lot with the : -with the way people speak . That is Swahili . But again you see language now how people communicate again on campus . Now when you are talking on the-about these people that maybe the janitors . You see I find a problem in those janitors , they do n’t understand us . Eeh , huwa hawatuelewi . Kama sisi huko . Kuna wakati nilikuta-kunasiku ile time ya I was still here new here tunajua the jani -the-the cleaners they had come mopped wakaenda kisha mi sikuwa nime mop so mi nilikuwa na mop kisha nika -when mopping maji yalikuwa yame end up kwa pavement . Huyu unajua alikuja kwanza akaniambia “ sasa unanidharau , ninininii . Unanidharau kwasababu wewe uko
campus hata kama sikukuja campus ” Na unajua they just seemed they do n’t understand so when nilipokuwa namwambia “ mi sikua najua . ” Anasema nyinyi watu wa campus huwa mnamadharau sana ” . Yea you see which means me too I think the mm-whatever-what I think is just there is lack of communication . Mtu sasa to them inaweza ikawa masomo yake ni ya kiwango cha chini but you see they need also to understand . Eh someone should at least give you time to explain na kama wewe there ’s a problem mtu hataki hata umuelezee hataki hata kuelewa . In fact hataki kuijuwa . Eh ana-eeh-the olden views that alikuwa anayo ati watu wa campus wanamadharau ndio atakuwanayo .
Now unajua let ’s say eti we are coming here again ukitoka wanakwambia “ eeh , mtoto wangu chunga campus . ” Hapo campus kuna ukimwi . So you see ( he laughs ) so I just used to wonder but my parents used to tell me campus there ’s “ ati hawa wasichana watakupewa ukimwi ” Sasa nikawa najiuliza “ kwani girls do they manufacture AIDS ? ” cuz they say “ hawa wasichana watakupewa ukimwi wasichana watakupewa Ukimwi ” so you see when we were coming here people view us as people who are- watu we are people who are wayward . And so that ukienda huko hurudi ukaenyumbani . Unapata hao-tuseme hata your older friends wale marafiki uliokuwa nao zamani .
Ukaambiwa " huyu mtoto wa nanii unajua ameenda campus . Na campus watu wameharibika . Atakuingiza kwa bangi . And so chunga na ukiwa na yeye chunga sana . Eh so , people view us as different using now language . Cuz again , you will find kuna wengine pia hawajui kuwaongelesha wengine . There ’s that etiquette , that is needed . That is the register [ uncertain transcription ] because you know that when you are here you should speak to people this way when you are here you should speak to people this way . Yea , cuz unaona , ingawa inafundishwa huko , mmm in high school but when you come here you ’ll see it ’s really evident many people-some of us who want to talk to them ambao unapata some people are rude . So they are-they are using that language maybe there to demean , to show that they have- yani wako juu kushinda wale wengine .
Mm . Okay . And generally what can you say about the change of meanings of words . So that nowadays we-we-it ’s like we are manufacturing new meanings .
Mmm .
So that when I tell you “ ass ”
Yea it means uuh ( he laughs )
What ’s-when I tell you about [ uncertain transcription ]
Mm hmm , yea it means there are people =
Why do you think we are coining new meanings ? Or we are coming up with new meanings of words ? It is that we feel the language is not adequate or we are just rebellious we want to speak the way we want and we want to come up with our own language because I think with time if we continue like that do n’t you thnk we ’ll come up with a new language ?
Yea , new language is in the making . There 's one that is about to come . But you see , all this inatokana na-na inachipuka . Hao mwanzo wake ni Sheng . Cuz you see Sheng there are people tha- yani if you look if you want to study this Sheng and now look words into which people come up with . Yani words za Sheng you see some , they just form the opposite of the word . Mm . Kama let 's say-eeh-they say uh , they form them using the opposite of-let 's say if a word is there nikienda mbele sasa now wataanza kui-kuisema ikirudi nyuma sasa . So you see , people-people are just making [ uncertain transcription ] and I think that they call themselves being digital . Sasa huko ni huko kwa hatari sasa .
( laughs ) You can say that is the creative nature of language .
Yea , that 's now the creative nature such that-like hata sisi tulipokuwa huko nyumbani nakua then mnazungumza kwahiyo mnajua you do n't have the-the words then mnajua people just say " sisi tutakuwa tukizungumza aah kinyumenyume " like for example tuseme =
Jaku .
Eh jaku .
Kuja .
Tuseme like for example there 's one in Swahili ati there 's a big story kuna -eh-in Swahili I think it 's from Form One . Unajua hiyo story ilipendaga sana . [ uncertain transcription ] inaitwa " Elewa Lugha Yako " . It 's a story Kiswahili . [ uncertain transcription ] there 's a story in [ uncertain transcription ] " ChemiChemi ya Kiswahili " , there 's a story in tha book , mama amesema elewa lugha yako yani mtu anafaa kuelewa lugha yake vizuri . So that you see there 's a man in that story that alikuwa amekwenda ku -forest . So then there 's a stut-there 's some students who are sent to collect some maybe-somethings from the forest . Tuseme kama uko primary mlikuwa mnaambiwa " kesho kuje na viboko " . Unajua unabeba kiboko ambacho kitakuchapa , so unaenda unatafuta ule mti wa mpera . Ambao uko straight unaleta saa hawa wanafunzi walikuwa wametumwa huko msituni .
So kufika wakakutana na a man , that man was really running , anakimbia yani as if something is chasing in him . So when he met those people akawaambia [ uncertain transcription , sounds like a potentially made up language ] so you see these people wakaanza kujianagalia " huyu man amesema nini ? " they are " what is this man saying ? " So wakasema " ah ! To hell with him wacha tuendelee na safari yetu . Wacha atatu stress bure . " So unajua [ uncertain transcription ] wanaenda wanaenda [ uncertain transcription ] so wakakutana na simba . Na that simba now started chasing them so all of them had to climb on top of the tree .
Then now they decided to remember this man had told them [ uncertain transcription ] . So you see wanajiuliza what does this thing mean so they decided to write them down now when they were back at school they- yani they made [ uncertain transcription ] . When they write it they decided now to read it ilikuja huku huyu mtu alikuwa anawaambia " rudini nyuma kuna simba huko mbele " . So ( laughs ) . [ repeats the words he was saying before ] So unaona these people they never understood this man na huyu man angetumia their lay language such that they can understand at least ile maafa ama mauti ambayo karibu ilikuwa inawakomba inge-wangeponyoka . So this language unapata people just choose them kuna wengine-kuna watu wengine tu hawajali .
Okay . So that when you use language in a specific way you tend to form a grouping .
Yea . You tend to =
Because now the way that man was speaking there is a group that speaks like that so just like they-{they are one }
{ Yea he thinks that they } know that . Yea , like let 's say hata sisi in high school . But now it 's them when disc was that common- unajua you do n’t have [ uncertain transcription ] but sasa at least you know the language , you know Kiswahili na we pia hukipendi Kiswahili cuz not so many people love Kiswahili . So you are speaking your language just the same same language but now you are : saying those words kinyumenyume so that mtu akikuambia you have spoken mother tongue he 'll ask you ati let 's say tuseme mm " kukuja " mnasema " bi " , b-i , so mtu ata-anakuambia " ib " , eeh " ib " . Ib ika . Yani bika eh . Sasa atakuwa ana change ' ibeka " such that when mtu anakwambia " onyango , ib eka " so huyu mtu hata haelewi . Hajui nini inafanyika even though you are-they are not speaking Kiswahili or English .
Hakuna mahali utawapeleka cuz ukisema " ib " , " Ibeka " make that atakuwa anasema " imeboeka " [ uncertain transcription ] . ( He talks for an extended time using nonsense words that are made up from contorted Luo words ) In fact that 's why these people kuna the hawataki watu wawaelewe . That unaona ndio maana hata Sheng ina-inachipuka . The vijana hawataki wazazi wa-wagundue wanayoyasema . Like for example people can be saying very dirty things near their parents . And the parents will not even know . Cuz when you say [ uncertain transcription ] parents watakuwa wanajua [ uncertain transcription ] . ( laughs ) , hawatajua . So now ni kitu watu wanataka yani kuficha siri nowadays there are too many secrets that people want to [ uncertain transcription ] hawataki ku : -kuambiana .
I do n't think there is a way we can-we can control that . There will always come new words and we 'll always attach new meanings to old words .
Exactly . Okay . Itakuwa ita-inachipukachipuka kila siku kama for example if you- kitambo when I was in high-in primary unaona hii mbuyu ilikuwa hiko mingi sana . Mtu anaichambua eti dad sasa ni " mbuyu " . Kisha ukiangalia huyu mbuyu [ uncertain transcription ] and that elder came and told us mbuyu ni mti mkubwa . Eh so when the-these people are saying yani they are now comparing maybe the power of the dad in the family yani someone who is powerful like that mbuyu . Si unaona wanasema like there are certain birds that stay in that mbuyu . Ndio maana kuna methali ikaja ati " mti mkuu ukigwa wana wa nyuni kuyumba yumba " . Yani there were now comparing that-mm baba to be now a tree so that whenever that people when they say that baba is [ uncertain transcription ] hako kwa nyumba see the home- home haitakuwa inaendelea ilivyokuwa inaenda . Kisha hii " demu " , si " demu " pia ni jina ya mtu but " demu " means kitambaa-kitambaa but kile kime chanikachanika kimechakaa chakaa which means now according to the way Walla was explaining to us he told us that now you see where now boys ama vijanaa they used to refer girl to a " demu " which means something that they just use-use it and leave it there . Eh ? Kisha " masa " . " Masa " si ni makosa . They say-ah when they say " masa " yani that is mom but in Kiswahili " masa " means makosa . So you see that one alikuwa anatueleza ati people yani being that parents , that especially the mother that they like now , mm , they-they like disciplining you . So you see people they use-they just produce a word according to how they associate the old word-according to certain characteristics . Yea , like that " masa " now cuz huyu mtu huwa kilawakati ukiwanakosa anakuchapa sasa anaona tusimuite masa na yeye . ( laughs )
Okay .
Yea .
Okay that 's all I have for you for today . Thanks a lot for your cooperation . You will enable this project to be successful .
Mm thank you .
Okay .
