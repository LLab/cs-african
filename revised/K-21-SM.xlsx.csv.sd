Karibu for this interview . Yea . [ uncertain transcription ] language use .
Thank you .
Yea , so we-generally how we use language .
Yea .
When we 're in the hostels , ukiwa nyumbani .
Yea .
Feel free just to discuss all that .
Okay .
And [ uncertain transcription ] let 's start by you telling me which language do you typically use with your family ?
Umm the language I use with my family is my native language . Yea . My mother tongue which is-which is Kuria .
Kuria .
Yea , the Kuria language .
So when you 're at home you- ni hiyo ndio unatumia ?
Yea , when I 'm at home with my parents that 's what I use .
With your parents .
With my parents , yes .
Do you have brothers and sisters ?
Yea sure . I have them . Yea .
Which the-eeh-which language do you use with them ?
Yea , now for : -for them , given that they know more than one language . Yea , they 're learned they know English , they know Swahili . So I do mix . Yea , we :
Kwa hivyo reason ya kutumia Kiswahili-nini-Kuria with your parents is because they do n't { speak any other language} ?
{ Yea they are not}-they are not well conversant with eeh English , though they can speak Swahili . Yea .
So they prefer Kuria ?
Yea , they prefer using =
But with your brothers and sisters you can =
Yea , with my brother and sisters =
Kuria .
Kuria , English , Swahili , Sheng
Okay .
Yea .
Okay .
Yes .
Haya , na rafiki zako nyumbani ? Your friends ?
Aah , with my friends it makes no difference aah , when you compare my friends and my brothers . So that kind of language used with my friends is the same as that which is used with my brothers and sisters . Yea , so I do mix .
You do mix .
Yea .
Why do you do that ? Why do you use all those languages ?
Umm , okay in the first place uuh-we use more than one language because most of us are more conversant with more than one . So it becomes possible for you to use more than one language . Uuh , some other times we mix because sometimes you do n't have so much time to think . Like you find a terminology which mea-maybe is not well understood in one language you find it possible to use that terminology in the other language . So =
So when you have a problem communicating something in Kuria =
Yea .
You shift to =
You shift to either English or Swahili .
Okay .
Yea .
How about when you 're in school here ? Hapa . Chuoni .
Aah , hapa chuoni now :
With your-your friends . What languages do you use ?
With my friends of course I cannot use my mother tongue . Yea because it 's not known to them , some of them . So I do use English , Swahili and sometimes Sheng .
That is with your friends ?
Ooh , that is with my friends yes . Yea .
How with other people at the university ?
Other people in the university , depends whether I know them .
Kama vile lecturers , your lecturers ?
Ah , my lecturers hapo ninatumia Kiswahili . Even they are my departmental lecturers .
[ uncertain transcription ] Kiswahili major .
Ah because I 'm a Swahili student .
Okay .
Yea , but if uuh , outside my department then I use English .
With other people you encounter ?
With other people I encounter Swahili , English , Sheng .
Okay .
Yea .
Do you think it 's important to know English ?
Very important . It 's very important to know =
Nipe na sababu . Why ?
Aah , sababu ya kujua Kiingereza . Aah , ni kwamba katika-katika lugha tunaambiwa kwamba : lugha zinajitegemea . As in they 're interdependent . So for you to be very eloquent in-in-in a language , then you must use another language to learn the same language . Kwa hivyo inakuwa muhimu kujua Kiingereza maana hata kinaweza kukusaidia kujua lugha nyingine kama vile Kiswahili na lugha zingine . Sometimes aah , you : -you may be in a situation where it 's a must that you use English . So that one makes it possible for you again . It makes it important for you =
Can you think of any such situations ?
The situations that aah , forces someone to use a particular language like English are like let 's take aah , for example .. tumeita miktadha rasmi . As in very , very special con-
Meeting .
Yea , as in very , very special context like a-a special meeting . Sometimes you met somebody who does n't know Swahili . He does n't know your mother tongue . That 's the-the only language this person can communicate with is English . [ uncertain transcription ] forces you to communicate with that person in English if that is the only language they can communicate . Yea , so those are just some of the
Context .
Context that forces somebody to use a particular language like English .
So you mean that even when like in Kenya we have most people know three langauges : mother tongue , they also know Kiswahili and actually Kiswahili is the one that is mostly used =
Yea , popular . Yes .
So even with that you still think English has an important place ?
Yea , English has an important place for example before-before language policy was uuh , was made into effect in Kenya . Aah English was a very , very special language that could be used in very special context like in court . Like in parliament . So at those times it was very important for one to know English .
Okay .
Yes .
Na kuna umuhimu wa kujua lugha ya mama ?
Yea , kuna umuhimu pia . Kwanza tunafahamu kwamba lugha ni kitambulisho . Kwamba ukiongea lugha fulani basi mtu anajua kwamba huyo ni wakabila fulani . Kwa hivo lugha ya mama inakuwa ni kama kitambulisho . Yea , a form of identification , it identifies you with the region maybe you come from . Yea , sometimes even the status . And sometimes-it 's just iden-identification . Yes it identifies you as a-as a person where you come from .
[ uncertain transcription ] like you mean that there are languages that have a low status , the mother-our mother tongues ?
Sure . Yea , like aah , it has not been proved . But there is a notion that for those uuh , smaller communities , those very , very minor communities in Kenya .
Like yours I know is what you mean ( James laughs ) . And so you might-you might be a little bit too sensitive , yes ? Tell me about that , explanation .
Yea , like-like mine when I mention that I 'm a Mkuria you know somebody would ask " where do those people live ? " In Kenya where do you find Kuria =
They do n't even know if =
Yea , it 's not that widely known .
How about some-ah-ah community like Kikuyu ?
When you mention a community like Kikuyu , you come to Kalenjins , you mention like the Luhyas , the Kambas =
Luos .
The Luos . Those are the people that are widely known . So it is assumed that those language-those languages have quite a higher status then uh
They have more of dominance .
They are more , they have dominated widely , then =
Because it 's-it 's more-but it 's just about population .
Is it ? About population and you know , the history of the community itself . Yea , there are those communities that have very short history . And there are those ones-those ones that were known very long time ago .
And also because of political .
Yea , the political power of a certain community .
Do you think that plays a role ?
Sure it does . Because if the politics of a country is dominated by let 's say the Kikuyu . You know that one places them in a higher status then those that never even appear in any of the political [ uncertain transcription ] . Yea .
So you feel neglected , marginalized ? ( James laughs ) . Is it how you feel , how your community feels when you 're at home ?
Umm , we just feel like we 're forgotten and-we 're forgotten and neglected . We 're marginalized . We are not recognized as such . So that even aah , it has been a current trend . Like aah , in the university that like some ladies from Kuria when they come over here on the campus , they really do n't want to be identified as Kurians .
Aah ?
Yea , they don-they really do n't want .
Wow , that is quite bad .
They really feel like aah , you know
Inferior .
Yea , there-there is that inferiority complex in them .
That is the ladies .
Yea those are the ladies .
Why do you say ladies na nyinyi wanaume ? What ? You 're proud or-or ( James laughs )
Sisi wanaume HATUNA shida kabisa . Yea , hata saa-wakati mwingine tunawasukuma pia . Yea , kuna ule msukumo tukonao juu yao kwamba " kwanini hamtaki kujitambulisha , kama Wakuria ? " * Other times we also push them . There it that pushing we are on on top of them that " why dont you want to identify yourselves as Kuria ? "
Is this very common ? The ladies ?
Yea , it 's very common the ladies all over the campuses in Kenya . Not only MOI . Yea .
Then that 's a dangerous [ uncertain transcription ] Wakuria . ( James laughs )
Yea .
Okay . Naweza-nataka ni-nijue kama wewe huchanganya ndimi when you 're using languages because you know so many languages , in a conversation ?
Yea . Kuchanganya ndimi unajua hilo ni njama ambalo hali ipukiki , kwa yule mtu ambaye anafahamu lugha zaidi ya moja . Yea , kuchanganya ndimi ni lazima . Na =
Kwa hivyo wakati gani [ uncertain transcription ] kuchanganya ndimi ?
Aah , kuchanganya ndimi kunatokea-kwa mfano kama niko nyumbani .. na hisi kwamba huu ujumbe ambao nataka kupitisha sitaki wazazi wangu waka uelewe . Kwa hivyo wale ambao ntakuwa nao itabidi mmechanganya ndimi wakati huo .
Sasa hawa ni kama wakina nani ?
Hawa ni kama rafiki zangu ambao wamenitembelea nyumbani , unajua tena mambo ya vijana . Yea . So wakati ambapo hutaki mzazi aelewe ama hata kama ni huyo-ni hao hao vijana ambao mko rika moja but you want to hide some kind of an info-information . [ uncertain transcription ] code-code-code switching becomes very evident .
Eeh naomba give me another [ uncertain transcription ]
Aah , changanya ndimi pia =
[ uncertain transcription ] hapa shuleni .
Hapa shuleni kuchanganya ndimi kunatokea : katika mazingira ya kawaida tu ya maongezi . Pale ambapo : labda huna mda wakufikiria msamiati ambao unafaa . Yea . Labda umesahau =
Lakini wewe ni mswahili ,
Naam .
Makini .
Naam .
Una-unapata kweli shida wakati unao-unazungumza Kiswahili eti msamiati fulani umepotea ama nini ?
Bila shaka kwasababu katika mazingira ambayo si rasmi unaruhusiwa kutumia lugha upendavyo . Yea , unaruhusiwa kutumia lugha upendavyo . Tofauti na pale ambapo mazi-mazingira ni rasmi , hapo unajipanga unasema kwamba naenda kuwasiliana-kama unaenda-kwa mfano ni kama naenda kufundisha ama naenda kwenye mahadhara basi , hapo unajipanga na unakuwa tayari kutumia lugha . Lakini kama mazingira si rasmi basi lugha unaichanganya upendavyo . Wakati mwingine inatokea kwasababu mda wa kufikiria msamiati faafa huna . Kwahivyo unaona wacha tu nitumie ule ambao nimeupata wakati huo .
Mm hmm . Niambie tena , hizi lugha ni-ni zipi zile lugha ambazo unacha-unachanganya ?
Aah
Maongezi
Lugha ninazozichanganya : Kiswahili kama ni hapa shuleni , aah Kingereza =
Mm , kwa hivo unachanganya Kiswahili na Kiingereza
Kiingereza-Kiswahili Kiingereza ama Kiingereza Kiswahili .
Lugha zingine ambazo =
Lugha zingine : hizi lugha za kienyeji , the native languages . Aah zile ambazo nazifahamu mimi .
Aah , kwani unafahamu lugha : [ uncertain transcription] ?
( James laughs ) Aah , kimsingi : naweza nikasema { nafahamu } =
{ Kuria : bila shaka }
Kuria hicho . Hicho nafahamu . Kuna lugha inaitwa Kisukuma ingawaji sio lugha ya Kenya .
Aah , lugha ya Tanzania .
Lugha ya Tanzania . Yea , naifahamu pia . Kiluhya nafahamu kidogo . Kikamba naweza nikasalimia , naweza nikatoa salamu . Kikikuyu kidogo . Yea , kwasababu ya maingiliano ambayo nimekuwanayo na hao watu .
Kwa hivyo wakati mwingine you use them also ?
Yea , wakati mwingine -for example if I 'm speaking to a Luo and I know quite of some Luo , yea I do-I do mix .
You mix ?
Yea . Yea .
Have you noticed a difference between the way you speak and other students ?
Yea , sure . The difference must be there . Yea , for example you realize you come from different backgrounds . Yea we were brought up in different environments , therefore you know language acqui-acquisition becomes different . Yea , the school-the type of school that you went-you started aah schooling
Tuangalie kama lugha ya Kiswahili . Tofauti gani wewe umeona ? Na yako na [ uncertain transcription ] wengine ?
Lugha ya Kiswahili , sana sana unajua hiyo ni lugha ambayo inakaribiana sana na lugha yangu ya mama . Yea .
Lugha za Bantu hizi
Yea , lugha za Wabantu . Kwahivyo tofauti iliyopo mimi nikiongea na : tuseme Mkushitiki akaongea ama Mnilotic kama Wajaluo , ni : ule uzito wa kutamka neno . Yea , kunakuwa na =
Aah , kwa hivyo nyinyi mna ufasaha zaidi ya wale ?
Sio ufasaha bali ni : unapata kwamba hilo neno umelitamka kwa urahisi zaidi . Yea , na yule mwingine amelitamka kwa uzito yani ni kama amepata-amepata matatizo kidogo katika kulitoa lakini ufasaha unabaki ni ule ule . Aah , tofauti inakuwa ni hiyo .
Kwa hivyo umeona tofauti-eh he , na Kiingereza na ?
Aah , Kiingereza : -Kiingereza-Kiingereza-Kiingereza tofauti inatokea wakati wa : -tunaita lafudhi , the accent . Yea , tofauti inatokea katika in the-in the accent . The way I pronounce some words may not be the way somebody else does . So our accents differ .
What if that person is a Kuria like you , is there a difference ?
The-the-the difference occurs like aah-for example if somebody has pronouciation problems arising from maybe the phonology or something . Yea tofauti inatokea hapo katika matamshi tuseme . Mtu kama ana kigugumizi ( stammer ) yea unapata kwamba hatamki vizuri . And aah , probably the kind of school . Yea , the kind of school this person went , the environment that uh =
Is it also-yea school . It is also regional ?
Um , yea . Like you know it 's of notion that um , people from the Luo Nyanza speak quite a different-a different English then people from the same region but of a different-of a different clan .
I know you neighbor them .
Yea we neighbor them soo sometimes you-you even heard-heard of this similar-this popular quote " Being a Luo is a lifestyle " . I think ( he giggles ) it just originates from how they talk , you know . Yea , so language use is-is-is again regional . Very , very regional .
Mm , okay . So you-when you listen to a : Luo speaking you will tell that this is a Luo ?
Very sure . Yea . You 'll be able to know just because of their accent . You know sometimes you even say that their words are-are loaded .
Loaded .
Yea , their words are too heavy . ( Both laugh )
In English yea ? But English is not their mother tongue why is it-why is that the case ? What-what do you think is the reason for that ?
Mm , aah , I really think it 's umm , the whole system of pronounciation . Yea , the whole system of pronounciation gives them that strong power to pronounce a word . Even if-even when it is very light it comes out as a =
Very strong .
Very strong word , yes .
So apart from a Luo any other communities , any other people from other regions , can you tell where they come from ? By-by just listening to them , the way they talk ?
Yea you can be able to tell , depending on aah-depending on aah , how much you 've interacted with aah-the level of interaction you 've had before . So like if-for example I 've interacted with Kalenjins , I probably know how they speak . If I 've interacted with the Kambas again , I 'll be able to tell how they speak .
So there 's a certain specific way that Kalenjins speak ?
Yea , you realize that aah =
All Kalenjins ?
Not all Kalenjins . Let me be specific like Kalenjins of the Nandi . I do n't know whether I 'm correct
The Nandi dialect .
Yea , the Nandi dialect . Their form of pronounciation is somehow very light and they speak in haste . Yes . Aah , neno
Even when they are speaking Kiswahili ?
Yes , all languages . And even-and even their own language . Yes . Wana-neno linatoka kwa wepesi lakini the pitch at which they speak is very high . Utafikiria anafukuzwa ama hataki yea , ama ni kama anakatiza
Is that because you have lived around campus here there are a lot of Nandis ?
Yes because-
Is that why you are familiar with them ?
Yea , I 've interacted with them on various contexts and =
How about people from coast province ?
Aah , people from coast province majorly we know that they speak Swahili most so : for example when it comes to Swahili , their Swahili : is quite fluent . Yea , it 's quite fluent and uh , if you listen to them very well you 'll also realize that they use a lot of aah-this other Swahili dialects . I mean the terminologies from other Swahili dialects . Not the standard Swahili that we have . But when it comes to English , they 're quite aah-they 're quite slow in adapting-in-in adapting to English . But very , very fluent in ah-in Swahili .
Other regions ? Like Nya-okay you talked about Nyanza of course . Central province , this is also the case-is this also the case that you can tell ?
Central province you can tell of course-ah-let 's take for example ah-the central province is dominated by the-the Kikuyu . Their accent is again very different . Yea , so language use as we said is regional you can be able to tell who comes from where depending on how they speak . Yea .
What if you 've-you:-aah-listen to somebody talk but you can n't see them ?
Aaa , as in are you able to tell whether :
Whether they-they are-the same thing like background {[ uncertain transcription ]} area , where they come from ?
{ Sure } you : -for example have you interacted with these people before ?
Like we 've-you 've-you 've been able to say that aah people from Nyanza as in like the Luo this is how they talk . The Kalenjins they talk in haste and uh-you know using a light language . Ah the coast , people from the coast are lowly ex-exposed to English . People from Central-you 'll be able to tell depending on the [ uncertain transcription ] how much have you interacted with them . Aah , we need to-we need to cover things like ah-other things that you can tell apart from-apart from the area [ uncertain transcription ] , are there other things that you can ?
Of course you hear somebody speak in the background aah , umm you 'll be able to tell the-let 's say even the level of education . Yea , you can tell the level of education of somebody .
How is that possible ? How-how can you tell ?
The level of education , aah can be measured using language by looking at aah , how correct and exact is this-is this person . As in from what they speak how correct and exact are they ? Aah , are they aah-is their speech taking into account the-the correct linguistic use ? Aah , are they =
They are not-what-how do you rate those people 's level of education ?
Mm , in the level of education like aah , like when you look at the linguistic features like let 's say morphology , phonology , aah-syntax , semantics , when somebody is not consistent or when somebody is not exactly following these features then you 'll be able to tell that this person is not learned maybe to a certain particular level . Like for example , aah a standard eight pupil um and a form four student , depending on how you 'd hear them speak you 'll be able to tell the level . Because like for example in Standard Eight or let 's say in the primary school level , those pupils are taught on how to use vocabularies . Not taking into account whether there is communication
Or not .
Or not . So like when you go through their essays and compositions you realize there is the-the adequeties of vocabularies , vocabula-vocabularies . But when you come to high school aah , the major aspect being considered is communication . It does n't matter the vocabulary used you 're looking for communication . So there is a change . So when you hear a Standard Eight pupil talk and you hear a Form Three student talk , you 'll be able to rate depending on who communicates actually .
Accurately .
Yea , who-who-who is giving out the communication . Yea , without taking into account =
[ uncertain transcription ] At the-somebody at level of university education .
At the level of university education we are looking at the exactness first of all . Aah , are you able to communicate . We are not taking into account the magnitude of the vocabularies you use . And again in the university we-we-we become more specialized . As somebody can talk professionally-professionalistic I mean , like if aah , this person does linguistics then you realize ah , the person tries to-to be exact because that is what they 're specializing in . If somebody is taking like let 's say medicine , then the kind of language will-will actually be geared towards-towards medicine , medicine , medicine . Yea .
How about other things like uuh- sijui mnaziita nini-nyanja tofauti katika society ?
Mm , you mean the-the ranking ?
Yes . Unaita nini ? ( they both laugh )
Hizo tunaziita matabaka .
Matabaka mbalimbali .
Matabaka mbalimbali katika =
Can you tell ? [ uncertain transcription ] . Unaweza ?
Using the language ?
Unasema eti huyu mtu anaongea hivi lazima huyu ni wa ile tabaka ya chini . Na yule mwingine ni wa tabaka la juu .
Yea , sasa hapo , aah kwa kuangalia tabaka la mtu katika jamii . Wale wenye tabaka la chini wataongea lugha ambayo haina usanifu . Yea , kama ni Kiswahili ataongea Kiswahili ambacho kinaelekea sana kufanana na lugha yake ya mama . ( giggles ) . Yea , hata wakati mwingine anachanganya lugha yake ya mama lakini anajifanya kuongea Kiswahili . Kama ni Kiingereza ataongea kile Kiingereza ambacho yani-ya , kile Kiingereza ( both laugh ) very localized eh ?
Very localized .
Yea a very localized English . So you 're able to tell like aah this person is of ah , lower status in the society because of how they use-they use their language . And when you come to the higher status people in the society unajua hawa wakiamua kwamba ni Kiswahili-kwa mfano kama anaposoma hotuba . Akiamua kwamba ni Kiswahili basi ni Kiswahili .
Kiswahili .
Na kinakuwa ni Kiswahili sanifu . Akiamua kwamba ni Kiingereza basi inakuwa ni Kiingereza na kinakuwa ni kile Kiingereza sanifu .
[ Uncertain transcription ] think is the reason for this ?
Aah , the reason for these differences just the level of exposure . Like aah and again it depends on the context again . For example that person who is speaking a localized English . Maybe the context allows so . Yea , but ah-take for example if-when it is the president maybe addressing the public through the media . Yea at that time the context is you either use the correct-align with one language or the other . So the president unaweza ukasikia anasoma hotuba kwa Kiswahili anairudia kwa Kiingereza . Kwahiyo hamna ule wakati akisoma kwa Kiswahili na achanganye msamiati wa Kiingereza hapana . Yea , kwa hivyo inakuwa ni kwamba muktadha ndio inaamua vipi lugha itumike .
Hivo umeniambia level of education na umeniambia pia hiyo ya tabaka tofauti =
Yea ambayo =
Lugha inaweza kukuonyesha .
Yea lugha inaweza ikakuweka kwenye tabaka fulani . Naam .
Any other thing ? Unaweza tumia lugha kumi ?
Kufanya nini ?
Just giving you more information about that person ?
Yea ,
Information into language use .
Yea , the economic situation of somebody-yea the economic situation of somebody can also be : =
Eh he , economics iko tied pia na ile ya : { tabaka }
{ Tabaka } But tabaka sasa-unajua tumeangalia tabaka kwakuangalia ule usanifu wa lugha kwamba utatumika vipi . Kwa hivyo inakuweka kwenye tabaka fulani . Lakini tunapokuja katika hali ya kiuchumi basi unaangalia uwezo wa mtu . Uwezo wa mtu . Umesoma au hujasoma ? Kumbuka [ uncertain transcription ] tunaangalia tabaka tulikuwa tunaangalia tabaka tukilinganisha na elimu , unaona ? Lakini sasa hapa tunaangalia-tunaangalia hali ya mtu ya kiuchumi na lugha . Aah , utagundua kwamba watu mbali mbali kuongea kwamba-mtu ataongelea kuhusu maisha yake . Maisha yake ya kawaida . Kwahivyo yule ambae ni maskini , ms-msamiati wa umaskini uta =
Na ule-ule ambae ni maskini turejelee tena ile { tabaka }
{ Ya tabaka } Naam , naam , naam .
Yule ambae ni maskini kabisa . Na : amesoma mpaka tuseme labda amefika chuoni hata =
Chuo kikuu .
Chuo kikuu . Na yule ambae ni TAJIRI , kuna watu kama hao
Ni kweli .
Tajiri lakini hakuenda chuo .
Kabisa .
Can-can you use language to ?
Well , uuh .. you know language use-like aah katika hali kama hio , yule ambae ni maskini lakini kasoma , yule ni mtu ambae ana matumaini . As in somebody who is hopeful .
Hopeful .
Yea . That 's somebody who is hopeful . Lakini mtu ambae : ni tajiri lakini hajasoma the language use will still take him back to the low-ah-to the status that is very low in the community . Just because of how they speak .
But huyo mtu ambae [ uncertain transcription ] kiuchumi could n't you think that his money will help him to elevate ( James laughs ) [ uncertain transcription ]
Well uuh , we use-we-we look at aah-terminology use . Yea , this person who is very rich but he has not gone to school is the same person-aah-his language use is the same as that person who never went to school and is still very poor . Yea because the level of exactness , observation of linguistic features will still remain the same . But huyu ambae amesoma lugha yake itakuwa ni ile sanifu . Yea , katika maongezi yake utasikia mtu ana matumaini , so in a way there is a difference . You went to school and you 're poor , you did n't go to school and you 're rich . So this person who couldn-who never went to school and is still very rich , he is still very low at the status of the society because of the exactness . He 's not that-he 's not that fluent .
Because of his language use .
Yes .
Na katika : muktadha wa : kisiasa , how is-can you tell that this person is from this party , the other one from the other party based on the language use ?
Yea , the way they use language-you see , now here we look at the positivity towards the-towards a certain political =
Party or =
A certain political party . Like somebody who is affiliated let 's say to : JUBILEE , that person would be very positive towards it so whatever is being said about it , is quite positive as-as-as aah =
That it comes out very clear .
It comes out very clear . He 'll always advocate for it .
Na yule wa CORD ?
Na yule wa CORD you know now they become like antagonists , in a way . So yule wa CORD , their language use will always be affiliated to CORD . [ uncertain transcription ] JUBILEE again their languages will be affiliated to that . So the-it 's about the positivity and negativity towards aah-political-aah-the political-certain political line .
So that is also possible as =
That is also possible .
You can sit down and listen to these people speaking on TV on a political show and even without being mentioned this one is aligned to =
Yea , this one is aligned to JUBILEE or this one is aligned to-to-to { CORD }
{ To CORD or any other party} ?
Yea .
Uliniambia kwamba you speak several languages ,
Sure .
So do you use these different languages , different people ?
Yea , it-ii =
Yupi for example ?
It really depends on who you 're speaking to . Like aah-for example you are a Luo and I 'm a Kuria then that means I 'm considering that aah-okay-let 's-let 's take into account our mother tongues . If we speak our mother tongues you speak in your Luo and I speak in my Kuria then we may not communicate . So that one brings us into use of a common language . Aah , if I 'm speaking to a Swahili who does n't understand English then it means that I-I use the same Swahili . If I 'm speaking to an English man who does n't understand Swahili then it means that I must speak-aah-I must speak English . So it really depends on who are you speaking to and at what context .
What context . Okay . Soo-like how-how about in school here ? Do you also find yourself talking different languages to different people ?
Sure . Like uuh =
Describe that .
Like aah , let 's take for example when I 'm talking to my : lecturer . My departmental lecturer . You know his expectation on my language use is that I use language to its correctness . I be exact in my language use .
Give me an example of being exact . Does he expect you to speak a certain language ?
Umm … he really expects me to-to-to speak even more than one language given that I-he knows I 'm exposed to my mother tongue , he knows I might be exposed to maybe Swahili . He 'll even know that I might be exposed to English and some other foreign languages . So his expectation is that during that particular context he expects me to use ah-the language in which maybe if I 'm a Swahili specialist then let me use that Swahili talking to him . If I 'm speaking to my linguistics lecturer like yourself then you expect me to be very exact with the-with English though I 'm not taking that . So we again-again language used with our lecturers we really see who .
How about subordinate staff ?
Subordinate staff , you know at that time now you really do n't know whether they-they know French . You do n't know whether they know English . So you slow down to at least acco-a popular Swahili language . So the subordinate staff we-we use Swahili . Yea , unless-unless there is an indicative-there is any indicator that this person is exposed to English then you 'll use English .
Yea , probably they speak English [ uncertain transcription ]
[ uncertain transcription ]
And you said your fellow students you can use English {[ uncertain transcription ]} or sometimes you mix =
{ Any-any } yea mix , even-even the vernacular 's here . Yea .
Have you ever tried to change the way you talk ? Anything about the way you talk , not-not everything-anything about the way you talk ?
Yea , like uh .. how I used to speak when I was still a student in high school may not be the same as how I speak right now .
You-you-you-you have changed ?
Oh yea . Very big change . I really think ( he laughs )
And was it-was it something conscious ?
It is n't something conscious actually .
It is-just happens .
Umm , it just happens that you find yourselves speaking in a particular accent which-which was not very popular .
Why ? Give me some , sababu kadhaa .
Sometimes it 's something which is intended . I just intend that I want to speak like this . Aah , let 's take for example I 'm speaking to a linguistic lecturer like yourself . You know , I 'll try to-to-to use language in a better creative way .
To impress me .
To impress you ( he laughs ) .
How about this , your fellow students do you have these situations where one student you wind up speaking to them in a certain way , another one [ uncertain transcription ]
It really happens like aah-talk of the opposite sex . Yea , like the way I speak to my-a fellow man might not be the sa-the way I really talk to ladies .
What do you think is the difference ?
Well-aah-in the contemporary society right now , people really , really want to seek recognition in various ways . And one of the ways is through language use . Yea so you feel that if I use language this particular way then I 'm a little bit I 'll gain some fame . Yea so at that time I may even drop my Swahili .
Aah ? Now you 're like this one you let me down ( James laughs )
Yea this is the only chance I have . So I 'll even drop my Swahili and aah-I get myself into the English which I think I can speak at only that particular time .
So like this happens when it 's fellow students .
It does happen .
How about at home with your parents ? Have you ever tried to change the way you talk ?
Aah-no .
That one is not the same .
No , no , no , no . That one is just aah-fixed and formalized like that . Unless-actually-yea I remembered . I remembered situations where I 'm just talking mother tongue but I realized I 've-I 've mixed a Swahili word . Yea , I 've mixed a Swahili word .
So in the past you never did that ?
In the past I never-in the past it never happened . But-as-as much as you 're moving away from your local community , there 's some terms in the same-aah-in the same language that may disappear from you . So at the time when you are communicating with them . At times you find that yani unatafuta huo msamiati unakukosa kabisa . So you find yourself mixing . Yea , you find yourself code switching with another language like Swahili which they know . So it has happened actually at home . That I 'm speaking to my parent who does n't understand maybe English-or-or who expect me to speak totally in mother tongue but then I 've mixed .
You find yourself mixing .
Yea , I 'm mixing , yes .
Mambo gani mna : zungumzia siku hizi -eeh-your hostelmates ? With your friends ? What are they talking about these days ?
Well , aah-just basically things affecting-aah the things affecting our lives . Like umm-mostly you 'll find the guys talking about relationships . Yea , information on break up of relationships is very common . Um the situation around the campus , like aah rape cases , insecurities , aah-go back to the entire country we look at politics . Of course like =
You always want to keep up what is going on .
Yea , what is going on so we discuss is actually about-just the current affairs . Yea , what is happening around the world . Around our country and all that . Yes .
Why do you think these are common-at least [ uncertain transcription ] relationships or [ uncertain transcription ] or political current affairs ?
Aah-for the current affairs most of us will want to be updated . Yes so through the sharing of information you 'll-I share what I have and then somebody else shares what they have then you get updated . About relationships there 's something that is inevitable . You really can n't avoid talking about them . ( Both laugh )
Is it something like a [ uncertain transcription ] . So that way it is mostly the MOST
Yea it is actually the most aah-those are the most topics . They really-aah-they really appear now and then . So you 'll find in this room they 're talking about the same thing . And the other room the same thing , the other room the same thing . But now under different situations . Yes .
Okay . So tha t-t hat is the MOST common . The reason is that it 's inevitable so that you 're talking =
Yea , you just can n't avoid talking ( both laugh )
[ uncertain transcription ] maneno ya : ulikuwa unaniambia ya Kuria women like they 're neglected .
They 're neglected yea .
Hebu niambie … in what ways can we correct that situation as a country ?
Mmm , well aah-you know as a country-ah-taking let 's say the collective measures is through the-I think the proper implementation of the constitution that we have .
So you- unaona kama katiba hii ina-ina-chunga wale watu ambao =
The minorities . Yes . It really-it truly caters for them . So if it is implemented ahh-kwa mfano you realize that aah-those marginalized areas . Now like in the devolved ah-government system , the senate governors and the governors down there they are able to reach any local and marginalized areas that was marginalized before . So through the efforts they can make these communities known . Like ah-do you know in Kuria ah-we have quite a number of ah-let 's say tourist attractive features . But these features have not been featured in the-in the Kenyan map just because the area is not recognized . So =
We hear of Massaii mara ,
You only hear of Masaii Mara , yea
So that I 'd like to visit , what is there ? ( James laughs )
In Kuria we have very , very beautiful scenery . We have very beautiful mountains . We have ah- quite a number of waterfalls in Kuria . This is just =
Hii ni-upande ya Wakenya ama una [ uncertain transcription ] ya Tanzania .
In Kenya , in Kenya . Yes .
Okay . Because I know kuna-Kuri-wakuria uwingi
Yea , in Tanzania .
In Tanzania .
In fact the whole province . Yea Kurians in Tanzania occupy the whole province but in Kenya we only have a district .
A district . A small area
Yea , a small district
[ uncertain transcription ]
Only it was divided into two recently .
Now you have two constituencies
Two constituencies . So in the recent past one constituency and one district in Kuria it had very , very beautiful scenery as I 've told you . There are mountains , there are waterfalls . There are good rivers . Umm-um-yea and so on . So these things , these features have not been given the prominence
They deserve .
They deserve . Just because of the marginalization of that particular area . So through the devolve I feel the devolved government will really-I really feel that ah-if they act to implementing the constitution we have then that place is going to be
Now you have two representatives in =
Yea we have =
In the parliament [ uncertain transcription ] You have a senator ?
Yea the senator of the county comes from Kuria . [ uncertain transcription ] comes from Kuria too .
So you feel you have ah-[uncertain transcription ]

Yea it 's just with the blood of the family so =
