Soo , thank you for making time for this talk about your : use of language in everyday life . So : I want uh , to start by asking you what language do you use with your family ?
My family members ?
Yea .
Eh the f-language I use with my family members , let 's see [ uncertain transcription ] brother , ndugu yangu we speak Ki-English with him . My mom and dad mostly Dholuo .
Dholuo .
Yea .
Uuh , do you sometimes speak to them in-in-in English or Kiswahili ?
Aah , ma-maybe my dad but my mom we specifically speak in Dholuo .
Dholuo .
Yea , she : -she does n't-she hates me speaking in those other languages . She says that I 'm now being too rude .
( laughs ) Okay , if you speak other languages you are rude ?
Yea , that I 'm rude , there are some things I 'm hiding I do n't want her to hear .
Mmm .
And so she says that =
Does she understand , eeh these other languages ?
She understands Swahili .
But she still does n't want you to use =
Yea she does n't want me to use this . She says that you see , lugha ya siku hizi unavenye [ uncertain transcription-recording has a lot of extra noise ] yani , that 's why things you can be [ uncertain transcription ] you can be saying something . But that 's not what it means . She says that we vijana nowadays we are tricky .
Oooh , okay .
Yea . So we might be saying something you are talking but in that you do n't mean whatever you are saying ?
Is it because you have done that sometime back ?
( laughs )
That 's that she knows that when you switch to-to this you ? Is it ?
Yea we do it commonly when I 'm with my friends . Yea so : =
So she knows you are , you are capable of hiding things ( Fred laughs heartily )
Yea .
And with your brother you said you speak English .
Yes .
Just English ?
Yea , mostly it 's English .
Mostly it 's English .
Yea but some other times can be Dholuo or Swahili =
Why ? Why English ?
I do n't even know but that 's [ uncertain transcription ] the context that we find ourselves into .
Mmm .
That 's where =
When you are at home =
Even when he calls me , it 's just English .
Aah , how-is he older than you ?
He is my elder brother he 's older than me .
Your elder brother .
The eldest in the family .
Is he : -eeh-somebody in some position somewhere [ uncertain transcription] =
Yea , he 's a teacher .
He 's a teacher .
Yea . He 's a teacher .
Is that some-do you think that could be the reason ?
Mm , maybe but ( laughs ) . You know I also to find that I just like it when I 'm with =
Is he a-is he an English teacher ?
No he teaches eh-CRE ,
CRE .
And Swahili . But mostly we speak in English .
Mm , okay =
Whene =
So his Swahili he knows . He 's teaching Kiswahili then he 's-must be very good . So he would speak Kiswahili if he wanted .
Yea , but mostly he prefer English .
( The background is extremely noisy ) You know there is this thing about Luo people . That Kiswahili ni ngumu ! ( Fred laughs ) Is it true ? That Kiswahili ni ngumu for Luos ?
Just like you said it 's a stereotype .
It 's a stereotype .
Yea because you see now jus t-t he last exams [ uncertain transcription ] going back to the KCSE and that the school that I think 2010 it was Kisumu girls and you see tha t-t hat is also in fact in the center , let 's say the heart of Luo .
Luo-Luoland .
You see and they beat people in Swahili . I also myself I did very well in Swahili and I am proficient in Swahili language so I do n't know .
You know there is a difference between written and spoken Swahili ?
Yea .
Yako ni ile ya kuongea =
Both .
Ama ya =
Both . I can =
You are confident ?
Yes I am confident . Naweza nikazungumza na kuongea .
So it 's a stereotype ?
Yea .
Eeh si ati it 's a true thing ?
Even though most people you find that yani they lack ah-they- yani mostly it is upbringing . Yani venye mtu amelelewa unaona ? Sisi mostly ukiwa huko mashambani ukizaliwa huko unakaa huko maybe lugha ambayo inazungumzwa pale ni Ki-ni Dholuo . So and you see language a person develops language majorly from their environment . The environment can determine what language a person speaks . So being that the-where we are it 's Dholuo and even if ukienda Class One the language that they introduce you to will be Dholuo . They will be teaching you in Dholuo from Class One =
I tend to have an issue with Dholuo . Dholuo is-is your language =
That is our language .
It 's your first language .
Exactly .
My issue is , why there 's this stereotype that Luos prefer English then Kiswahili . They mostly =
Prefer English .
Yea .
I think one of the reasons =
Especially when they speak to people who are non Luo .
You see , when-why I think most Luos prefer English . In fact yani na wanasema ile [ uncertain transcription ] , the : high status that the English language has been given . And you see nobody likes to be lef t-t o be-to be left behind . ( they both laugh heartily )
The Luos wo n't like to be left behind .
Exactly .
So you are now agreeing that the stereotype [ uncertain transcription ] as true .
Yea it might be there .
So we-what languages do you speak with your friends ?
My friends we speak Sheng , Swahili =
When you say Sheng what do you mean ?
This the-the language of the vijana . Eh hii lugha mpya imezuka . I find that =
So it is-it 's so-it 's a language that is .. a language in itself or a mixture of languages ?
It 's a mixture of languages .
Which languages do you mix =
Mostly in Swahili and English .
Swahili and English .
Yea .
So when you are talking to your friends you mix .
Yea you mix Swahili =
Any Dholuo sometimes , with your friends ?
Dholuo , that is when I 'm with my Luo friends .
Eh he . I 'm talking of those friends at home and I assume most of them will be Luo because it 's-it 's Nyanza .
Yea , but again just like you had said . You said those that have gone to school , they would really-they wo n't really like to speak in Luo .
Aah [ uncertain transcription ] ( they both laugh )
So if I â€™m with them , the language that we speak mostly it is not Sheng it 's either English or Swahili .
Friends in school ?
Friends in school . Again like let 's say here in school I have mm-several different kind of friends and most of them you find mostly in Swahili or English .
Most of the Kiswahili .
That 's the language that we speak .
Others ?
Others like my Luo friends we 'll always speak Luo [ uncertain transcription ]
Even here in campus ?
Exactly . See , the matter-or the reason behind is just for convenience . There are certain =
It sounds like you want to talk about these other people from { other communities } .
{ Ah ah ! } No , there are certain things that you do n't even have their words-their the-their tongues how you can hold them in Luo , in-maybe in English so , for-for that-for a person to know it better you just have it to say it in the language that that person understands .
Understands .
Yea .
Which is Luo , in this case .
Mm hmm .
Okay . Do you think it 's important for-for you or anybody to know English ?
Yea , I think it 's important { for people to know } .
{ You think it 's important }
Yea .
Why is it important ? Ina muhimu gani ?
Mm , sababu ya kwanza maybe mtu kujua Kiingereza , you see it 's-eeh aah-things like this you say that the language that is spoken-the widely spoken language in the world I think it 's English . So , if you-nobody want to be left behind just like I had said . If you do n't know this English how will you communicate [ uncertain transcription ] . Like you find that-I personally I do n't know French . And in Facebook I have French-friends who speak French they do n't know English . So you find that for us to communicate maybe I have to get another friend who knows French then he translates tells me that if you want to say " hi " you do write this way then that person replies and you { see it 's really tedious } .
{ Does that prove } tha t-t hat it is important to know French ?
Yea it 's also important to know these other languages such that =
Why do n't you learn French ? Now that it 's also important . Not English . Why do n't you learn the French ?
Mm , maybe it 's the environment where I am in . Find that the environment where I am in =
Is not French .
French is not that-is not that common . In fact like in our class we only have one person who is confident and he can speak solely in French . So ni ngumu sana mimi binafsi kujua na kuanzia kutoka primary school , secondary school =
You have been using English .
Just English . Hata sijawahi kuwa kwa French class .
Mm hmm . Na Dholuo ? What-is it important for somebody to know Dholuo ?
Yes ! That 's very important . Mandatory . A person must know their language .
You are-eh he ? Why ? Why I mean because you can-you can survive without Dholuo .
Yea .
And there are those Luo eeh people who are born for example in these urban areas . Okay . Not only Dholuo even others-these other [ uncertain transcription ] born in urban areas , grew up speaking Kiswahili and =
English .
English . That is why-why do you say it 's mandatory =
But you see it 's very necessary . For : -just for personal safety like let 's ss-take the example for the one the post election violence that happened in Kenya in 2007 . You see , there are some people that the- yani ile time kuzaliwa , ye alizaliwaga town . Kila kitu akafanyia huko na lakini alikuwa anasikia eti " kwetu " , kwetu ni a place inaitwa Bondo . So vita vimetokea anataka aende huko . By the time anafika he reaches maybe that place [ uncertain transcription ] so do you see these people now trus t-t hey start trusting ati huyo naye anatoka wapi ? Kisha unapata doing that this person hata hajui lugha yake even communicating to these people is very difficult . So I think knowing your native language , hey it can also be used as a tool for identifying you . Yea , that this where you come from because [ uncertain transcription ] kama wewe you know that language . You know , when let 's say you have a problem , you can be traced-your origin can be traced that this person he 's called Ochieng and yes that is a Luo name but he does not know any Luo . So because you see Luos we also have different ways of speaking . If let 's say someone is lost then he says that " I 'm called Ochieng " . Then I-according to the person that you are with you will know that this Ochieng is speaking some Luo . And this Luo is the type of language he 's speaking is majorly common let 's say in [ says a Luo name/word ] , therefore you can be taken there . That is just for identification . And another thing is you see our culture . People learn culture through the languages . Because just like I had said kuna maneno mengine ambapo ukitaka kuzungumza maybe kwa Kiingereza you 'll never get them .
You 'll never
So that 's why I-at least tukijua ile lugha yako your native language I think it 's better .
Aah . So : English , native language in terms of importance both of them are important to-you feel that English could be more important ? [ uncertain transcription ] or it is the other way around ? Which one is more important for you ?
Uuh , between these ?
Yea .
I think now I-in matters of importance , in the world that we are [ uncertain transcription ] nowadays I think English it is a bit-is more important because the offices that we : maybe let 's say when looking for job , they never tell you to write anything in your native language . Let 's say it 's a cv you are writing , that cv is written in English . Then most offices it 's just English .
Then there are people who-you come from [ uncertain transcription] ?
No I come from Siaya .
You co-come from Siaya [ uncertain transcription ] ( noisy background ) . Went to school with men or women did nâ€™t go to school , just do their-their work . Is there-is there fishing in Siaya ?
Yea there 's fishing . Yes .
They just do their fishing , they grow up doing fishing , living their with their families , get married there . Is it important for them now to le-because they do n't access any offices for example . Is it important ?
But even in those places , they might need aah-they might need assistance .
In the offices .
Yea , in the offices =
But mostly , you go to an office , you 'll find watu wenye ako hapo most of them I-are =
The natives .
They are the native speakers or , one of them even if the office I want to see is not-is not a speaker of Dholuo , there 's somebody there who can translate .
Yea , but ah =
So is it important for such a person ?
Yea , it 's also important at least you know because let 's say-let 's say the offices that you go out to , the people that you find there , they are Luos . And you see , aah-the : -how-the world is changing . Things are becoming digital . How will this person not use these aah , things if he does not know any other languages ? Like for example a phone . You see you can-you cannot just give someone a phone who does not know maybe how to read . Mm , how to read maybe writing that one is not a problem but reading because the phone needs you to read whatever is written on there so =
So it seems they cannot escape from this
Yea they cannot . Let 's say there 's M-Pesa here . Itabidi , kama unataka maybe ku withdraw pesa kupelekea mtu wa M-Pesa umwambie " hebu fanya hii , fanya hivi na hivi . Niweke PIN . PIN nasikiaga eti it 's my year of birth . Hapo =( they both laugh )
Mm . So you can see your money .
So they can see your money . So it is important at least mtu aijue .
So umeniambia you speak eeh-Dholuo , Kiswahili , English . Any other language you know ?
I 'm trying to learn these other languages .
Like ?
Like maybe Kikisii cuz most of my friends so whenever we are together I ask them " let 's say you want to tell someone that I love you , how do you say { it in your } language ? "
{ How do you say it } ( the both laugh )
I think-I think-I personallly I also have an interest in language so I try it .
You try it .
Naweza uliza mabesties wangu at least waniambie , at least hata . Cuz I used to hear that during that post election violence , that some people only the-the language saved them .
Saved them .
That because let 's say you find a troop of people somewhere , they are killing maybe a particular tribe then you see the best way they could identify they could just come and tell you and maybe greet you in their language . If you manage to answer , they know that you are a member and they let you go .
They 'd let you go .
Soo ah-that-I also time to avoid-but tha t-t hat does not mean that I have hopes that such things might happen , no . I only trying that at least nikue ready .
So for this ones that you know , do you mix them ? In-in-in the conversation ?
Yes only if I am with those who to show that I also know a little bit of their language .
No-not-no I 'm-I 'm-I talk-I mean-I mean the ones that you know . These languages that you know . English , Kiswahili and Dholuo . Languages that you 're fluent in . Do you mix them in conversation ?
Yes , I mix them .
In one conversation ?
Yes .
You do ?
Yea I do .
When ? For example
You see one of the reasons I try maybe I-we can mix them =
Just tell me when first then you 'll=
When ? When I do nâ€™t have the vocabulary for that language maybe that we are speaking . Let 's say I 'm speaking English then I do n't have the vocabulary for that term at that particular moment then I can switch . Yea maybe =
Is it that-is that the only reason ? Could you just also do it even when you know the words in the other language ?
Aah some other times it happens at least to- mtu kuonyesha umahiri wake katika lugha . Yea , maybe you want =
I 'm good !
I 'm good in this and this .
And I can switch anytime .
Anytime I want .
So why do you ss-do you-do you do the mixing- unachanganya kwanini ?
Kuchanganya . Sijui -that 's ju-like I had said , tuseme sina yale maneno ambayo yanatakika na let 's say you are explaining someone someone about this one . I-i-in Kiswahili how would you say that . [ uncertain transcription ] you 'll just have to say ati " jana nilipokuwa nikisoma our fluorescent tube iliunguwa " . Cuz you wo n't have that term sasa kuelezea mtu =
You do n't have the time to start thinking .
Yea . You- utafikiria-utafikiria =
Niliambiwa nini kwa shule ?
Yea , eti fluorescent tube nini ? See I lost-so as to also save time .
Okay . Economy .
Yea . Economy .
So which languages do you mostly mix ?
Languages I mostly mix ? Mostly English and Swahili . Mostly .
Mm . Sometimes Dholuo ?
Yea , sometimes Dholuo but eeh =
And what do you mix Dholuo with ?
Eeh , whatever I mix Dholuo with maybe if I 'm speaking to my Luo friend and there 's something I 'm trying to explain to him =
No , I am saying yea . You-of course when you are mixing with Dholuo it has to be a Luo friend [ uncertain transcription ] . So which other language would you be mixing with when you are talking to your Luo friends and you are mixing , Luo and what else ?
Maybe-mostly English .
Mostly English . ( they both laugh ) The stereotype [ uncertain transcription ] . Not Kiswahili . I 've had Luo friends , I know some words in Luo cuz I lived with a Luo when I was a student . For almost three years . So usually I would hear them when they mix it is Luo , Kiswahili ? Ah ! ah !
( both still laughing ) Kiswahili ni kidogo sana .
Kidogo . So it is something that I think is a stereotype but it also has some truth in it .
Yea .
Mm . Have you noticed a dif-any difference with the way you talk and the other students ?
Yea . Yea , I talk-it 's unique to myself . Yea because I-in fact when I talk-le-let 's say I record myself then I hear-hear that the way I talk is only unique to me . There 's nobody else =
Have people told you that ?
Yea they =
Ama when you are talking somewhere , somebody can easily say " ah ! That is Okello . Okello is [ uncertain transcription ]
Yea exactly , they know . In fact everyone that I-I attend choir practices everday that 's from Monday to Thursday kwanzia eight . Sasa unajua tukiwapo kwa choir kuna hao watu wananiambia k- " hebu ongea . Mi I like the way you talk . That Luo accent . " ( Interviewer laughs )
The ladies .
Yea the Luo accent mi inanifurahisha .
Aa , cuz of the Luo accent . And eh-is it the same , for you with the other students ? Can you identify other students by the way they-they-they [ uncertain transcription ] speak ?
Yes I can . Yea , you see like the Kisii just like I told you I 'm so close to the Kisiis . And you see they have their own way of talking such that when there 's someone is in the other room and it is closed , then you try =
[ uncertain transcription ]
[ uncertain transcription ] at the meaning of whatever is being said . You just realize they 're Luo or a Kisii .
You 're saying a-a Kisii you can easily tell =
Yea , I can easily tell that this one-this is a Kizi-a-a Kisii . And again you see mostly because they 're certain languages-certain maybe let 's say sounds that they find problems that some other tribes find problems with . Like you see mos t-t hese Kikuyus mostly you 'll find they 're saying " r " and " l " -the differences .
[ uncertain transcription ] Mix .
Yea . So if you are just listening to someone then you hear-ins-say so many " r " s instead of " l " just know that " ah , that one has to be a Kikuyu . "
Aah , okay . And eh , can you listen to someone talk and you say " this man or this lady must be from Siaya " . Where you come from ?
Yea , that 's most . That is more specific then let 's say speaking Dholuo . You see Dholuo you have different ways through which different people speak . The words , might be the same but now the way they are being pronounced is a little bit different .
So Ujaluo wa Siaya na ule wa Bondo na ule wa Kisumu you can =
Yea you can just tell that this one-this one comes from { Kisumu } .
Jakisumu . This one is =
This one is from Ja-this is Jasiaya . Because-but maybe some other person who is not aa member might not know because the words might just be the same . But now the way in which a person says-says those words [ uncertain transcription ]
Mm . That 's interesting , I thought Luo is just Luo . ( Fred laughs ) . Whether you come from Kisumu or you come from Seme or wherever it 's just the same .
It can be Luo but you see yani it 's different from [ uncertain transcription ]
Yea , I 'm saying I did n't imagine . But you can know-you are telling me that you can =
You will know .
You can know .
Yea .
Aah . Okay . And eeh â€¦ yea . You did nâ€™t exactly tell me how you can tell that ? Is it-is there something that some features ?
Yea you see there are certain features that you-that are unique to each and every individual . Yea . Like you 'll say and these features you can only know by maybe being close to that person =
Not just individually because we are talking of ,
A region . [ uncertain transcription ]
[ uncertain transcription ] Siaya , Kisumu , Bondo . Is-is it =
Yea-yea-there are jus t-t here are features-there are features that =
Example .
Eeh , you see maybe there are certain people-like they-they-they are fond of talk-of speaking quickly . Like let 's say Luo . See they 're a certain group who that when they 're speaking you find that the rate at which we pronounce words-that which they say they speak these words faster . So it 's-it 's common to a people of that particular region so when you just find that someone is saying things very fast , you know this one-if not that he 's coming-if not from Siaya then maybe he has- kuna wakati alikuwa anaishi hapo .
Alikuwa anaishi =
Yea he stayed there for sometime and maybe he was influence by the , the behavior and the way of speaking of that particular group .
Ay okay . And other things apart from where somebody comes from , what other things can you tell from the way they are speaking ?
Mm hmm . Other things apart from the way the area but can maybe tell you that this person is from this { from this} =
{ No } Let me put it this way , eehm â€¦ for example area . When you speak to somebody you have told me that you can tell this person is from a certain region .
Okay .
And not just within .. eh-eh-Luoland . Even in other parts of the country cuz you mentioned Kikuyus they have this problem , sijui nani where they have this problem . So is it eeh .. is it also possible to do that without seeing that person ?
Without seeing ?
They are just talking in another room and you are not seeing them . You are not seeing them . But they are on radio cuz radio you do n't see who is on the other side . Can you tell that this person is from a certain area ?
Yea now tha t-t hat now depends on the way that person speaks . And if you 're familiar maybe-you see you must know . For you to identify , you must know the characteristics tha t-t he-the-and the way-or a way in which people [ uncertain transcription ] speaks . Like uuh , tuseme watu wako kwa radio wanazungumza . Kisha maybe the people tha t-t he person that is being interviewed . They co-there 's specific ways in which you-you hear this person talk . You think you can now identify or you can mm- yani unaweza ukalinganisha jinsi ambavyo huyo mtu anaongea na jinsi watu wengine wa eneo fulani kuongea [ uncertain transcription ] ukasema =
Na vitu kama tabaka mbalimbali . Tabaka =
Katikaa :
You know tabaka ?
Yea , the : -the classes made with people ?
Yea , can you tell-can you tell somebody is from this =
Yes they 'll know =
Certain class ? Based on the way they speak how is that possible ?
Like you see the rich people ? They : -you see they rarely speak . Kwa -like from the area I come from these people who are rich hawaongeagi sana . Maybe just say hi . Eh , like maybe in an interview a person is [ uncertain transcription] =
How about those people from [ uncertain transcription] ? ( Fred laughs )
Maybe those ones speak but you see maybe these rich people-anyway I do n't know what is wrong with them but hawapendagi kuongea so maybe unaona mtu ana-anaulizwa swali kisha unase-una- maybe =
Very brief .
Yea he gives very brief answers , as if =
But these other people ?
Maybe ah-the-the-the =
Poorer people .
They expand , they add certain words like-see it 's as if a person is answering an interview and the interview is maybe questionnaire and the question is closed question that " how many children do you have ? " , keeps quiet .
That is what kind of person ?
Those are the rich people .
Mm hmm .
They are those people that they are =
And these others what do they say ?
They also-these ones they give so many information that you know one there is a time that this another one died , but at first I had seven but now being that they had died there are now six .
Always a lot of stories .
Yea . And also the politicians . See they speak a lot . Yea , the politicians they like-they are people who- wanaongea mengi sana .
Mmm .
[ uncertain transcription ]
So in politics =
In politics the power is just to convince . They want to convince and you see you cannot just convince a person by a single word . So that 's why =
To talk a lot =
Lazima uongeengee mengi sana .
So politicians you can identify them by =
Venye wanaongea , you see they have that command of language . You find that when someone speaks you want to listen . You want to hear " eh , what next is he going to say ? " And that is most qualities of these politicians .
But are all of them like that ? Because they are some that nikisikiliza I get bored and they =
Those are the ones that maybe there 's something that took them into politics =
The passion .
Yea , it 's not their passion maybe they have their own motives .
How about things like education level of some people ?
The level of education of a [ uncertain transcription ]
And the language they use to tell you that this person is =
Yes .
Of a certain level of education ?
Yea , the language that a person-yea that can tell you =
Even-even Dholuo .
Exactly . But Dholuo-not Dholuo but maybe these other languages that I 've learnt in school they can help you know that this person maybe reached this [ uncertain transcription ] this-maybe this-reached this level . Like you see , when we finish-when we cleared our exams , that is in Form Four . We used to go to meetings and I wa-used to-I was the secretary so I used to record mi-minutes . Then that our group we had people . So many different kind of people and being that ndio nilikuwa nimetoka shule I was just back to the village hawa watu sikuwa nawajua sana . Sijui alisomaga hadi wapi . Then now during our meetings when that someone says something that-I-I-want-want to spoke something here " . So you see I used to wonder ati " you want to spoke something " wha-what is the problem with this English that had to spoke something . ( they both laugh ) .
So you notice that this person =
Then I went and asked my man that " yule mtu tunakuaga naye kwa kikundi chetu . Kisha and everytime he just says he wants to spoke something . Please can I spoke . Alifikaga class ngapi ? Then my man told me that one left in Class Four . So I said okay , then it 's alright with him .
( laughing ) You do n't expect-you do n't expect somebody of Form Four or university to say that .
Unless they reached there through the backdoor . Back-the person who just reached there in the normal way
The normal way
Would not say that .
Eh which is the normal way ?
The normal way is that maybe
You pass your exams .
You pass your exams and go . [ uncertain transcription ] tu maybe mtu-mtu anaanguka , anaambiwa you have to repeat kisha mtu anakataa hapana . If you 're told you say [ uncertain transcription] =
The political affiliation ya mtu .
Mmm .
Can you tell like this person , the way they are speaking or the way they are talking this person must be from this political party . This other one from the other political party , is it possible ?
Maybe now when you 're looking at whatever the agenda or maybe whatever that party stands for . Yea , let 's say like uhh-let 's say a party like TNA , stands for maybe free laptops to the-eeh- watu-wanafunzi wa shule . Wale wa Class One . So see if I [ uncertain transcription] =
So it will only be related to
Yea maybe
The way they are articulating the-the : -nini
The manifesto hivyo [ uncertain transcription] =
What if it 's a new [ uncertain transcription-noise in background ] we are discussing something neutral abou-like vision 2013
Mm hm .
And then we have two politicians speaking . Can you tell that this one is CORD ?
Yea according to =
And this one is from JUBILEE ?
Yea according to-for-for-for what-you see , whatever that person says can-can tell you because and just like maybe we had said manifesto . You see these people whenever they are discussing something they always want maybe the-to write what they stand for .
[ uncertain transcription ]
Yea , they type to whatever they stand for . So if let 's say you are discussing and someone kila wakati anasisitiza tu yale ambae yeye anaona ni mazuri , ama yale ambao alikuwa anapigania wakati wa maybe campaigns . Then k- unaweza ukajua eti " huyu mtu "
So you can easily align .
Yea . When huyu mtu anaongea seems-they-he stands for this .
Soo these languages that you know , do you speak different languages to different people ?
Yea .
Mm hmm . Where ? Example ? Or when ? For example when ?
Aah maybe the languages that we speak maybe its Swahili . You see kuna hii Kiswahili [ uncertain transcription ] mnaweza kuomba nayo [ uncertain transcription ] that one you can speak to your friends . Then let 's say you 're with someone who is high-in high rank . [ uncertain transcription ] that person [ uncertain transcription ] Kiswahili . Ile Kiswahili unakitumia lazima iwe na kiwangu fulani . Lazima kifikie kiwangu fulani . Then kama pia ni English . You see-wh-when you are with friends , you do n't even bother taking turns [ uncertain transcription ] and all that . But now when you 're with some [ uncertain transcription ] that maybe- matters a lot or are that high in the position you have to ensure that the language that you speak with them is up to date .
Aah so every language that you use is always =
Yea , it depends on who am I with .
Mm . Have you ever tried to change anything about the way you talk ?
Mmm , no .
As a person .
No-not .
Is it the same way you used to speak when you were in secondary ?
Yea , it 's just the same same way that I used to go =
You have never felt the need to adjust the way you speak ?
No , maybe-let 's say maybe in um , language-maybe yani let 's say the way I use my language maybe that 's what I 've tried but the way I speak , the way I articulate my words always want that I do it =
But [ uncertain transcription ] with other students
No .
Kama unajaribu kuongea kama fulani . Have you ever seen ?
Yea I 've seen it with my friends-s-see maybe like we doing the media . See , you find that may-mo-most people they say " oh I want to speak like Judy Gishuru , { I want to and you see them and they } try and they in-some manage .
{ And they do it and they try to do it } Mm .
Some manage .
And the others ?
Others do n't ( they laugh ) , they 'll start then at the-at the maybe-they 'll forget and go back to their normal way of speaking . Like there 's a day mm we had gone to the studio , yea maybe to-there 's a show for some other person- tulikuwa tume-tulienda . Tulikuwa tumeingia-tumeingilia tu ndani hatukuwa-yani hikuwa rasmi . So kufika huko tukapata kulikuwa na wasichana wengine nafikiri-ilikuwa [ uncertain transcription ] hao walipata idea . So the way these people they were speaking . They were : they had changed so much that you could even realize that this one this is not the normal way this person-cuz you see they 're-they 're really trying . Kujaribu sana ili at least they manage that face and you see =
So you can just see this is fake .
Huyu ana-anang 'ang 'ana tu
Anang 'ang 'ana
Eeh . [ uncertain transcription ]
Na wengine ako perfect kabisa .
Ee wengine they know you cannot even tell .
Mm .
Like most-most of these comedians who even they-when they imitate some other people unless you see that " ndio huyu Erick Umundi anaongea ' unajua kumbe-kumbe sio Muhammad Ali .
Sio . Yea , because he can really do it very well .
He can really do it very well .
What are the issues that aah , [ uncertain transcription ] now ?
Saa hii ?
Yea . [ uncertain transcription ] topics .
Maybe saa hii students mostly they discuss maybe exams but again cuz they discuss inalingana na which gender . Like you see me most of my friends have been ladies . And you see ladies when you are with them they discuss relationships . That 's what they-they 'll just tell you " Charlie yangu amefanya hivi " mara " Huyu amefanya hivi " mara " huyu amefanya hivi " , that 's may-when you 're with the ladies . So like the all-I 'll say most of my friends , in fact nine over ten of my friends are ladies . So I have very few male friends .
Very few male friends . Is there a reason for that Okello ?
Yes .
What is it ?
You see me from maybe let 's say tangu nizaliwe yule mtu ambae amekuwa karibu yangu amekuwa mama yangu . Yea , so I find that maybe these-
Aah , you find yourself comfortable with =
Comfortable with the ladies =
And what they discuss you find it interesting ?
Not some-at sometimes most [ uncertain transcription ] but remember they said if you cannot beat them join them .
Join them .
Yea , being that they 're my friends-they all know that if I want to please them and if I want to maintain the friendship I must also just join whatever they are saying . Yea , so kama ni ma-mambo na mapenzi ndio wanaingilia that 's what I also . I also just go there and we fit in and I find that it goes on well . Yea but =
Things-these ladies are just about mapenzi or =
Ah ladies . Ladies in fact ninety percent of their time they 'll say is speaking about mapenzi .
Have you found an equal who have talked to you about something like politics ?
Very few .
Very few ( laughs )
( laughs ) One of out ten they will-but if we-if it goes again too much they 'd say " ah , stop " and maybe tuseme mtu anataka kukuuliza " sasa hii nasikia what does the opinion poll say " . Eh , kisha unamwambia kuna venye tunakuja then maybe you start saying-things that haoni kama ni ya maana kwake . Yea , kisha atakwambia " Ah ! Hapana . Jua ache tu I just wanted to know the opinion poll . Just =
Hakuna haja
Hakuna haja kuingilia mengi .
So is it different na wanaume ?
Yea wanaume is different you see =
What will they be talking ?
Wanaume mostly they talk about football .
Football .
They tell you now ManU
ManU sijui
Arsenal , the new signing . That jealousy sijui yule mtu amenunua [ uncertain transcription ] naenda kuwatwanga . So boys mostly you find that it 's football and politics .
[ uncertain transcription ]
They talk about politics again .
Okay .
And you see but-that 's now where I-that 's why you see mostly I do nâ€™t like being with the boys because when they start talking about politics
You are off .
I am off because the-the : -yani they argue so much as if they are-let 's say you-you-you are talking [ uncertain transcription ] about someone =
Do n't you belong to a political party ?
Mimi I do nâ€™t belong to any political party .
Mm . So that could be the reason you are
Yea you see let 's say like during the elections . Even though I do n't belong to a political party but I used to support [ uncertain transcription ] . So you see you are arguing with a friend and that friend insists that Uhuru is the best one so you try to explain your point na kuwa-hupati
Humshikani
Humshikani . You realize that maybe hata vita inaweza ikatokea . So I really hate to talking about politics .
Okay . Eeh : what do you want to do after you finish ?
Mi nikimaliza shule ?
Mmm .
Mi si [ uncertain transcription ] tu nikutafuta kazi na kupata . Then I relax .
You relax and enjoy your
Niachane na ma-kuamkaamka asubuhi asubuhi
Mm . Where would you work , ideally for you ? Ukipata kazi gani ndio unasema " this is =
Aa mimi =
What I want to " =
Mimi nikiwa studio , that will [ uncertain transcription ]
Aah ! As what in the studio ?
Maybe in the studio there maybe a presenter . But mostly maybe a comedian .
You seem to be so very comical ( Fred laughs ) . You enjoy that .
Aah , that-that 's what I enjoy .
And do you think it 's necessary that you need this degree that you are doing ? To-to do what
Me there are certain things I do n't think even are necessay . This our system sometimes I hear people talking about the system . Those you find that whatever they say-they-our system of doing things in Kenya here-you see sometimes hata I say I do like =
Sasa wewe you are in the wrong place .
Not wrong place . You see there are certain things that are not necessary . Like-like in our course we are doing certain mathematics . Do you think that mathematics is [ uncertain transcription ] in the studio ?
( laughs ) . No , even-even if you want to be a comedian on radio . They are so many of them . Hawana degree .
Yea , there are so many . That 's why I am saying " mm mm . you see you are just here because it 's again the system that has put us here . " They say that now- yani unajua ili upate kazi kwa urahisi utabidi-utabidi uende shuleni
Ukuwe na degree
Yea , at least ukuwe na degree ya -because even the politicians . You see they want to say that at least you must have a degree . Sasa wana unapata inakuwa ngumu . Like you see recently kulikuwa na hii , story hii ilikuwa I saw it on Facebook and also in the magazine . Kunao mtu anakuaga -he was in ghettofm , whose whom sijui [ uncertain transcription ] says a lot of [ uncertain transcription ] there in the morning . See he used to earn some very few amount of money there the [ uncertain transcription ] employed him . Saa hii he earns six fifty per month . And you see this someone who never went to school does not even have any degree , he just goes ati he makes noise [ uncertain transcription ] nininini =
People enjoy it
And people enjoy it . And you see the-they 're also there =
[ uncertain transcription ] like you if you want to do comedy do n't you think you are wasting time here ?
No . Comedy =
You could be there already earning money
No , comedy is not my main thing but-main thing maybe nataka and at least nikuwe maybe an editor . I have a-I have [ uncertain transcription ] I will need to be here . It 's also because of the system . The system demands =
You keep saying the system ( he laughs ) , what is this system ?
You see-that is how the-those people- yani wanasema the system-the system that we are following that is our system of education , the system let 's say you want to get job , there are certain rules , the criteria that you have to follow at least you have uuh- umetoka shuleni , uko na degree na si degree you- umepita and that 's when you-the employer [ uncertain transcription ] kazi .
They will always look at that . You have this , you have that .
Even experience . And you see that experience maybe utaipata tu kwa kwenda shule .
Mm . Wow okay . Asante kwa your time . This has been an interesting conversation . Thank you so much .
You 're welcome .
