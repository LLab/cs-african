[ Unclear transcription ] our conversation today . We want to discuss on how we use language everyday .
Thank you .
So wewe utumia language gani na family , daddy , mommy , sister , brothey ?
When I 'm home , I use uh , Kalenjin .
Kalenjin ?
Yes , but the dialect is Kipsigis .
Okay .
Mhh . So we normally communicate in Kipsigis . Ahm , the whole of my family , but when I 'm with my friends back at home , it depends on the , the friends that I 'm having also . Because I have friends who are in college as , as a drop- school drop-out , maybe form IV or primary school . So I choose the language depending on the- the easiest way to communicate with them .
Mhh .
Yes .
Do your parents encourage you to speak Kipsigis or is there something- is it like a rule then , they want you to speak Kipsigis and not English or Kiswahili ?
[ Actually ] there is no rule but we just find they are comfortable with Kipsigis . So I will not try to speak in a language that they struggle speaking .
Okay .
So Kipsigis is more ah easy for them to communicate in .
Mhh . What about in school , kama sasa hapa campus ? [ unclear transcription ]
Campus [ unclear transcription ] . Natumia English , Swahili and also Sheng . [ Unclear transcription ] mixing English and Swahili . So , when communicating with my peers , natumia tu English and Swahili na mixture . A mixture of the two .
Okay .
But when in class , we use English .
English ?
Aa .
Okay . What about when you meet the lecturers huko kwa streets ?
The lecturers ?
Mh hhh .
English also .
Even in the streets ?
Even in the streets .
A eh ?! Okay .
Because English , the- it 's a language that I think- Okay , how I perceive it is uh- , it shows some respect . So when you communicate in English , there is- there 's some respect that you are according the person . Or sometimes , the lecturer might also be some- someone who is of age , above 50 years , and they 'll not be- they will not understand Sheng if I talk to them in Sheng . Or maybe they are not comfortable or really conversant with Kiswahili . So English is the better option .
Okay . So do you think it is important to know English ?
Yes , it 's very important .
Mhh . What are some of the benefits ?
English , uh , most , most of the time , when we have discussions even in class , we use English to communicate . In teaching , it is English that we use in , in class . The education system in Kenya , is such a way that all the text , [ unclear transcription ] of the text are in English . So woe unto you if you do n't know English . Yeah , so it 's really important to help you in the academic field and also in the career field .
Okay . So you think we learn English because of the benefits ? If we had a choice , maybe there were no benefits , would you still want to [ know ] English ?
Ah , if there was a choice , ah … I even doubt it that I 'll be- if I would be knowing English as much .
Okay .
Kwa sababu , mimi ninge- ningeona , " Mhh … " It 's like I 'm straining to learn another new language , yet I 'll already have one . So I would see no need of-really going into another , uh knowing another language . So … yeah-
Mhh . Because of the benefits ?
Because of the benefits , we have to .
Okay . And what about our native languages , kilugha cha mama ? Importance yake ni nini sasa ?
Importance yake , nilizaliwa kama naongeleshwa Kipsigis . And that is the identity that I received from my parents . And if I never knew Kipsigis , I really- I would feel like I 'm , I 'm missing out on many things . Because going back to the village , niende niongeleshe my granother Swahili or English ... I mean it would sound really- I 'm not part of that community . But the Kipsigis now identifies me with that group and gives me a sense of identity and belonging . So I think one really needs to know something in terms or their , their native language , not only to provide our sense of belonging , but also in communicating . When you go back to the village , most of the people do not know English or Swahili that much . So the only means that you can effectively communicate with them is using that native language .
Mhh .
Yes .
So , do you think people who are bough- brought up in urban centers [ unclear transcription ] wamelelewa town . There are mixtures of so many languages , hata wakienda shule wanaambiwa , " It is English . " So at the end of the day hata hawajui ki mother tongue . Do you think they have some disadvantage ?
Mhh … I really do n't think they are disadvantaged . Lakini kama wataenda huko ushagoo the country side , that is where the disadvantage will come in . Kwa sababu they 'll have to communicate with those , those even old people and their friends back in the village . But if their friends in the village understand , the- the- English and Swahili very well , then there will not be a disadvantage . They 'll , they 'll communi- they 'll still communicate effectively . But kama kuna [ unclear transcription ] hawaelewi Kiswahili and English and they have to communicate , now that 's where our problem will come in . Lakini , if the- the situation that they do n't have to go back to the village at all at all , then it 's not a disadvantage . Si lazima wajue their , their native language ,
Okay .
if they were not born into it .
Do you think this knowledge of native language , because , when you identify yourself as a Kipsigis or I identify myself mbe as a Kikuyu or a Luya , do you think that was the cause of a problem in 2007 , the post election violence ?
Uhm … I really do n't think the- our differences in language is what brought out- about the … the clashes . There were other underlying factors . Sasa watu wakatumia that difference in language to justify a Kikuyu fighting a Luo or vice versa .
Okay .
So really , ni kama kulikuwa na shida with the housing , kuna shida na eh … living conditions . Kwanza in Rift Valley , the- there are Kikuyus in Rift Valley . So , the Kalenjins who live in Lu- Rift Valley see the Kikuyu 's as competitors . So when the clashes , the- when the- there was this dispute 2007 , dispute of general elections . That is the time that people took not to iron out their differences . So , it- it was n't really about the languages that they were speaking . Ni ile waliona you are a competitor na lazima tukutoe hapa .
Okay . So we can n't blame language ?
We can n't really blame language . Ya , but , hasa it 's kind of complicated , because language also identifies you to that specific group .
Okay . It 's evident that you mix languages in your conversation , at least at one point . Why do you think you mix ?
Uhm … ease of communication really .
For ease of communication .
Ease of communication .
Mhh .
There are some things maybe uhm , I do n't have vocabulary for . So I 'll- I 'll opt to choose vocabulary from the other language that I 'm- that I have . Ndiyo kukuwa na hiyo mchanganyiko and bring out the communication .
Mhh . So at the end of the day it 's for ease of communication .
Ease of communication .
Mh hhh . And what languages do you tend to mix ?
English and Swahili .
English and Swahili .
Yes .
No Sheng anywhere ?
Ah , Sheng pia natumia , but rarely because , uh , nowadays I rarely use Sheng .
Why ?
Ni kama inakuja na maturity . Kianza kuongea ile Sheng unafikiri , " Oh , no way , I ’m not . "
Mh hhh .
Yeah .
Okay .
But when I was in first year , ama even in high school , kuongea Sheng was the in thing . Kama hujui Sheng =
The swag .
Yeah , it was the swag .
Mh hhh .
So , kama huwezi kuongea Sheng unaonekana mshamba .
( laughs )
But now when we become of age , do you realize Sheng is even ghetto-ish , do- hutaki kuidentify . But sometimes inabidi utumie when you are with some friends . Ukipata marafiki zako wamerudi Sheng wote hadi unaanza pia kupick , one , one , two . Na pia unataka ku- kuweka yako [ mwanza model ] usionekane like only talking fluent English or fluent Swahili . Yeah , so - so , in- i- it depends on the- the group that you are with . If that group is speaking Sheng , for you to fit in , ipe uwanza kuongea that Sheng kidogo , unajua . Sense of belonging .
Okay . So you think sometimes the language you speak is a result of maybe being pushed by something ?
Yes .
Mhh .
The kind of interaction- or the kind of people that you are interacting with .
Will determine the language that you use .
Will determine the language that you use .
Okay . Is there a difference- ama ume notice ati wewe unaongea different from vile besti wako anaongea ?
Yes .
How do you know that difference ?
Aah , the difference comes in maybe in pronounciation of words and maybe [ unclear transcription ] of vocabulary . There are some people who are affected by their mother tongue . So they 'll have problems when communicating or when pronouncing certain words . For example in Kalenjin , people have problems with the plosives , especially the Bs , Ps and even K and V . They 'll interchange it . Where there should be a B , there 's a P . Where there 's an F , they put a V . So , really it is a- that- that your mother tongue influence [ unclear transcription ] support that difference .
Apart from mother tongue influence , is there any [ pinets ] , if it 's not in the accent now ?
[ Uncertain transcription ] place of vocabulary ?
Okay .
Uh…I 've been reading lots of uh , articles on the internet , novels . I love- I love literature [ unclear transcription ] . So I think , uh , the English that I have maybe , might be different from somebody else who- who does n't uh- read widely , or who does n't read uh , novels , or other- other journals .
Okay . So you can tell if somebody is from your area from the way they speak ?
Yes .
Because of the accent ?
Because of the accent .
Okay . What about if you heard someone speaking and you can n't see them , maybe inside a room like this , and you are walking outside there . And you could be familiar , maybe it 's your lecturer or your friend , and they are inside a room , and you are passing by . Can you tell ?
From their tone , I can tell .
Mh hhh .
Yes .
Apart from the tone ?
Mhh … It would be hard , because , uh , if I … the- the- the- tone that they use- they use is the one that I use to
identify
to identify them .
Okay .
But if that is now out , it will be hard for me to identify them . But maybe if I continue listening to them then hear the kind of conversation they are having
You can tell .
from- from the words they are using , now maybe that 's why I can tell , that is so and so . For example , some people like to- to use a- there 's a- some conversational …
We call them " pet phrases . "
Pet phrases ? Yeah .
Mhh .
That 's why you can- you can tell that is so and so .
Some people claim of intuition . Do you think that is true ? That if somebody is your friend and you are close , you can feel .
Aah … wa-haa , how that is … Maybe it only applies to some individuals , not everybody .
Mh hhh .
Yes .
Mh hhh . What about someone 's level of education , as in mtu akiongea , utajua , " Eh , huyo amesoma mpaka level fulani . "
Sure . Sure .
You can tell ?
You can tell .
How ?
The vocabulary they are using , the- the sentence construction . They 'll tend to have simple sentences , not complex . And their vocabulary will also be simple . Somebody who has gone up to , let 's say Master 's level , and somebody who dropped out in Class 8 maybe , the kind of English that was taught in primary school is totally different from that one that a Master 's student knows . The vocabulary that they 'll be using are totatally different . They 'll be sub- the- the- Master 's student will be substituting , or will be using vocabulary that are advanced level from that- from someone who has not gone to that higher education .
Okay . What about position in the society , what you call " status . " [ Unclear transcription ] know you have the higher , the- the average and the lower . Can you tell from the way they speak ? ( laughs )
Mtu wa kawaida , mtu wa kawaida anaongea kawaida tu . Lugha ya kawaida , mainly Swahili . Lakini kuna yule mtu maybe wa kati kati anaweza kuwa anachanganya zote mbili . But you 'll get that someone , uh … an executive , ama tu somebody like maybe our- our vice chancelor . I 'm very sure anakuwa ana communicate in English because he 's someone official , ama sijui ni kwa nini . I do n't know if it is because of status , ni watu upenda kutumia English . So you can tell , u- mtu aki- kama mtu anaongea English sana sana , utaanza kumwona , " Eh , kwani mtu anafanya kazi wapi ? " Ama jui ni wa wapi ? You tend to question because it is totally different from what you are used to . So I really think there 's- there 's a difference in the way people use language according to status .
And do you think it 's because English came with wazungu ile watu wasema , " Eh , ilitoka huko na wazungu . "
Ilitoka wazungu .
Does that really- is that the cause of us giving English a very high status because mtu akiongea English , anaonekana ako juu .
Yes . ( laughs )
Lakini mtu akiongea Kiswahili tume associate Kiswahili na ? watu wa kawaida .
Kiswahili na wa kawaida tu . Mwananchi wa kawaida , ndio maana unaona , Taifa Leo , ile inatu- inaandikwa na Kiswahili . It 's a very small paper because the target population that is being the- who are being sold to , ni watu wachache sana . Most people want to buy Daily Nation or Standard , which is in English . So it tells you something about the- the status we 've accord English . I think everything , tena ukiona kama advertisements , iko in English . Halafu saa hizi wana- wanataka ku- kuandika an announce- ama an advert , aiming at those people of a lower status , wanatumia Swahili . Si kumaanisha Swahili imedhalilishwa , English imepewa status nyingine iko juu sana . And just for the fact that English inatumika US and those other developed countries . So we give it that status too . And we also want to be accorded that status when we speak the English .
Sasa , tukaweka , tumeweka Kiswahili chini . Because kama kwa Constitution yetu si- ti- in fact Kiswahili ndio iko na- iko na- it 's like iko juu because imes- it 's a national language na an official language . English tu ni official language .
Official language .
But still unaona hizo mbili hata hazipatani . Still ukipata mtu anaongea Kiswahili na - [ makes some sound ] . In fact hata watu waki- wakienda rural areas , kama unataka kuji show-off na your friends , what do you do ?
English . ( laughs )
( Laughs )
You definitely use English .
You use English .
E ee .
What about political affiliation ? Kwanza kama sasa hizi conclude general elections . Mtu angeongea ungejua huyu ni wa party fulani , huyu ni wa party fulani .
Uhm … okay , that 's that one is hard to tell , just based on the-
The conversation .
the conversation . But maybe if you get into analyzing the details , from what they are saying , even the vocabulary they are saying- they are using , I mean , you can- you can tell . If you hear people talking of a , " We have- we are very much jubilated , " Why you 'll see- you 'll start- " Heh ?! This guy is jubilated " yeah ? So that 's definitely from the- the Jubilee side . Then uh , there- there 's a , the [ uncertain transcription ] party was which one ?
Mhh ( laughs ) . Code .
Code !
Yeah , coded .
Yeah , someone tells you , " We are MUCH coded ! " So-
There 's a [ uncertain transcription ] vocabulary .
I think it 's from the vocabulary . Between the vocabulary .
Mhh . Language is very powerful in that case .
Yeah , it 's powerful .
And you had talked about talking a different languages to different people . Can you revisit that ? When do you talk this language , to who , where , why ?
Ah . Yeah…it 's a
That touches on setting .
On the setting ?
Yeah , the setting .
Yeah , first of all the setting , if I meet- let 's say I come to one of these officers , I 'll use English in communicating . It 's an official language . But when I 'm in my hostel room there , I 'll be using Swahili . English will just be a little bit . Also depending on the person whom I 'm talking to .
I wanted to ask about that . In the office , if you find a friend or somebody you know like me , and you want to ask something , will you still use English ?
Now because I know you , I might choose Swahili or English . But before I knew you , I 'd use English . I think , it wi- u- we use- we use English for even people we- we- we do n't know , but for someone now we are comfortable with , tunaweza tumia > other , any other language . Hata kama nimekupata kwa ofisi , this office , and you are a Kale , and I know you speak Kale , I might even communicate to you in Kalenjin . Ndi ilete tu that- that sense of we belong to some- some- some- some language group .
What about kwa kanisa , kwa church ?
Kwa church ?
Mh hhh .
Church also ina depend ni church ya wapi . ( laughs . Interviewer joins in the laughter . ) ' Cause , if it 's a church in my rural area , I 'll use , ah , Kipsigis . If it 's an urban area , it is English . Swahili , Swahili pia in church itapewa that , that status sana . Uwa kuna service ya Swahili baadaye after ya English . Ama kuna one hour thirty minutes ya Swahili service , then the main service is in English , and there 's no translation . ( laughs )
So , it 's still even in church Kiswahili does not have status bado .
Swahili , haina status .
Mhh .
Ya , but in some rural areas ndio wanatumia mostly , uh , Swahili . And also , I 've also realized one thing , that some churches who 'll- who love to use Swahili . For example , this church , uhm … Jehovah Witness . Because they- they- they have these officers to the rural areas , they were using- they were using Swahili . But some other churches now use , uh , English .
Mhh .
Yes .
Why do you think is the reason , so that you- you change your language , depending on the setting and depending on the person ? Why do you think- what is the reason ?
It is to accommodate them . Because if- if I cannot accommodate you , then I 'll not be communicating [ uncertain transcription ] . For example , I have- if I have a friend who is a- who is a non-speaker of English or Swahili , and I 'm with friends who are all speaking English . That person will have problems if I do n't consider them in that con- conversation . They 'll be left out . But maybe , I 'll- I 'll now start , uh , to- talking to him , " This guy has said this : " I try to translate . But if we are all speakers of Swahili , then somebody who is speaking English- Okay , let 's assume you all know English and Swahili , but we were speaking Swahili . Then somebody joins us who is not conversant in Swahili . We switch to a language that the person will understand , so we accomodate them .
So at the end of the days , to accommodate so that you communicate .
So that you communicate .
Cause the aim of language is ?
Communication .
Okay . Ushai jaribu ku change vile unaongea ?
Mhh …
Know we have styles [ uncertain transcription ] why ?
Aaaah … Ha ha(Laughs ) . Wow . Depends on the people you are with , the setting also , yeah . Kama niko na marafiki wanaongea some kind of English , where- where kuna English kuitwa kuweng , talking like- like the mzungu now . Sita jiweka [ uncertain transcription ] ( interviewer laughs ) . Mi pia English yangu tu ni ile ya kawaida . I 'll change it a little bit . Naona kama ni pronouncing some words in way I 've never tried . ( Interviewer chuckles ) . I 'll really try it 's hard . So that I 'll also accord myself some status to be in that group , to fit in that group .
Okay .
Let 's say you find some people waki- wakienda huko ng 'ambo , wanarudi kama washa develop that accent . So they try talking like the people they were interacting with .
Ee .
Yes .
Mhh . Okay . And eh , what are some of the issues as a new bonga nyinyi siku hizi na kwa mabeste ?
Ma beste ?
Mhh . Kwanza tuanzie na males . Unajua some- sometimes [ uncertain transcription ] bonga na males , [ uncertain transcription ] tena mna bonga na [ uncertain transcription ]
Yes . Sure , sure . In terms of events , apart from gender , I can be with my male friends , but there are some things I can s- I can chat with na huyu mmoja na huyu mwingine siwezi ongea nae . So it depends on person's preferences . Kama huyu jamaa hapendi kuongea about , let 's say chicks , siwezi anza kuongea nae a topic he 's not comfortable in . Maybe tuanze kuongea biashara . Na nilikuwa na wa- jamaa , he 's not even business-minded , hana those entrepreuneral ideas , siwezi anza kumwambia my business ideas , yet he 's telling me about a chick he saw somewhere . Yeah , so , it depends on the personalities . But mainly the guys talk about ladies , we talk about money , they talk about uh ... generally their future , how they 'll succeed , how they are going to have that- that money . But [ uncertain transcription ] it 's all about money . How they are going to have money in order to have a car , so that when they have this money , they 'll win this lady . Yeah .
What about females ?
[ When ] with females now ... sentimentalist .
( Laughs . Ronald joins her in laughing )
Okay , actually , not all of them , but … Mainly when you- when you are having that conversation , they 'll tell you about , maybe their love life , they 'll tell you about something they- they airing someone . Maybe they 've seen a dress , they 've seen this new hairstyle , they 've seen this uh ... this fantastic romantic movie , something that will touch on the emotions . Yeah and maybe ... also about their future because they on that security .
Okay .
Mhh , so , mi nataka kuwaeleza [ uncertain transcription ] future yao [ uncertain transcription ] .
Mhh . Kwa nini unafikiria watu ongee especially eh- it 's- those are the [ uncertain transcription ] ( Ronald laughs ) whether ni relationship , ama ni hiyo pesa , kama ni ma dames [ uncertain transcription ] sundress , kwa nini sasa ?
You 'll find people rarely talk about something-
Es- ka- kwanza ya books-
kama politics-
ama books .
Ama books .
Mhh .
Hee utaanza kuongea na mtu ambao uta - that course your taking . You 'll talk for- you 'll talk about it maybe for five minutes , but you 'll not extending to even fifteen minutes talking about-
Story isha isha ?
It 's boring bana . ( Interviewer chuckles ) Utasikia tu jamaa hapa , na huyo jamaa anaamb- anaongea tu about class , class , class , class . ( Interviewer chuckles ) . Watu wanapenda vitu inawafurahisha . Things to do with happiness , things that will give them memories of the past maybe . But also in memories about happy things they- about experiences they 've had , but outside classwork . Because people like to have fun . So when you introduce things [ uncertain transcription ] to do with thinking , to do with mental thinking-
Watu wataki .
Watu wataki sana . Mhh .
Comment on Sheng . Do you think about Sheng ?
Mhh …
Does it have a future ? I- its benefits mingi kuliko disadvantages ? Basing on the fact that Sheng ni kama [ uncertain transcription ] ina affect Kiswahili ? ' Cause utaona mtoto ongea tu Sheng , but kama ni English , compositions and everything ataandika tu , lakini kikuja ni Kiswahili , eh t-inakuwa disaster .
Terrible .
Mhh . So what do you think about Sheng ?
I really must say Sheng … Okay hii ni as much as it is now having a place in the society right now . But it 's affecting , uh , mainly Swahili . Not much on English , but it 's affecting mainly Swahili . Because you find the- these guys who speak Sheng , tell them to write a story on anything but in Swahili , or just even speak fluent Swahili , it 's really hard . So nadhani it has affected the Swahili language so much . But apart from the fact that it is- it is an identifying factor fongs- for some groups , it identifies you from maybe a certain group of people . Kama watu wa Nairobi , kama mtu anatoka ... like uh ... it is mainly those ghetto areas , ehm , uh , I 'm sorry to say . Unapata mtu ametoka mahali kama Mathari ,
Kibera .
Kibera . So it is something they identify with . Na wakipata mtu anaongea the same way they talk , wataclick because wanaona huyu ni mmoja wetu . Lakini hiyo pata watu wanaongea Sheng , then you start talking English , pure English only , they 'll sideline you . Watakuona you do n't belong here . So apart from that thing inawapatia the sense of belonging , real- ime - it has eroded that language . Yes , so ... It 's not- the benefits are being [ uncertain transcription __trade ] by the effects , the negative effects . Yeah .
And there 's something very interesting , you will hear people saying , " [ Uncertain transcription ] talking ongea Sheng ya Nairobi si Sheng ya LD , si Sheng ya Kisumu , si Sheng - as in hata sasa the Sheng itself , it 's like kuna dialect , so that tutasikia say Wanairobi wakisema , " Aaah ! Sisi ndio wenye Sheng . " Sheng iko juu huko .
Aah .
Mhh .
[ Uncertain transcription ] Sheng inatokana sana ( smiles/chuckles ) tena Kikuyu .
Yeah .
Because hawa watu wanaona - the guys who are from these Sheng words , Kikuyus maybe . And they live in Nairobi . Maybe Kikuyus and the Luos . Sasa mtu anatokea Loret hawezi anza kutoa tu maneno yake aseme hii ndio Sheng yetu . ( Laughs ) . So there 's that differences in terms of regions .
Yeah , the regions . Because , also in Nairobi , utasikia Sheng ya West Lands-
Ni tofauti .
Si Sheng ya Kibera .
Ee . Unajua Kibera kuna hardships . Sa ' nadhani Sheng itatokana huko ni Sheng ina- inahusiana na the environment that you are in . Sa ' kama tu niko around ah- I ’m around uchafu ( interviewer chuckles ) , around vitu za ku hustle , hizo matatus , eh , buildings tu ile - the shanties . Siwezi toa the same , same Sheng kama naishi somewhere in West Lands ni it 'll be totally different .
Mhh .
Mhh . So I think ina depend na the environment [ uncertain transcription ] pia .
Mhh . Okay . And what does that tell you about the nature of language because that is language . Unaona - in fact , eh , those who have studied a bit of Sheng , they say , Sheng kuna some bit of Kikuyu , some bit of Luo just as you have said , and then wame mix tu Kiswahili somewhere huku na huku sometimes in hata inatoa English [ uncertain transcription ] . It 's like it 's a combination of a number of languages . What does that tell you about language ?
Yeah , yeah . Really , really , if people can have uh , Kikuyu words , mix them with English , have words from Luo and mix them with Swahili with English , then form another language called Sheng , that it means language is something that is evolving . You can form as many , uh , as many , uhm , what can I call them ( chuckles ) . Yaani unaweza form language zingine from another language . Through borrowing and also forming other new words .
Yeah , you are right . And also I think it 's also about eh- because ukiongaleta in some of this Sheng words , ni majina tu tulikuwa nazo , but wamepizatia new meaning . As in- old words =
Wana change new meaning .
new meanings .
Wana change meaning .
Mhh . ' Cause kama kitambo ningekuambia - Okay- Some , some , some words are so- hazina heshima they say . Mtu akisema , " Ass , " long time ago ,
long time ago .
kuna kitu ilikua inakuja kwa akili yako . But [ uncertain transcription ] mtu akisema , " Ass , " eh ! Heh ! ( Sighs ) They- it has a new meaning , it was an old word , but it has a new word- a new meaning . Mtu akisema , " John . " John was a name , but there is a way =
[ Uncertain transcription ] connotation .
Kuna connotation yake . Mhh . So , yeah , just as you said , language evolving so that tunapata new words combination of those the languages , ama , zile zenye ziko tunazipatia new meaning .
New meaning .
Mhh .
Hata according to technological changes ama advancements , tumeona vile mobile phones imeingia . There are words zimekuwa formed and are now used commonly . Zimekuwa hata household names , zingine- inakosa tu kuingia kwa dictionary , kamusi . Inatumika unaona tu , kama ukisema , " Bamba . " Bamba is now a scratch card ; nisaidie bamba five , bamba twenty , bamba fifty . But bamba initially , if you look at the , eh , Kiswahili sanifu , meaning of bamba . It 's totally different from the meaning that it now has . So I think also in future , as technology continues to change , new words will be according more than one meaning .
Yeah . Now earlier you said language identifies you . Like , kasasa ulisema kama ni Kipsigis ni ku identify na wakipsigis . Do you think hii story ya language and the culture thing ndio imetuletea this new things like lesbianism and homosexuality ? Now that- those things ni zilitoka West . Ukiangalia traditionally , hakukuwa na vitu kama hivyo .
[ Uncertain transcription ]
In fact , it was an abomination . Lakini siku hizi you have lesbianism , you have homosexuality , we have INCEST , something that was never there in our tradition or society . Do you think ni as a result of hii English so that English- I mean language inabebananga na culture yake , so ni kama unataka kusambazia hiyo culture yao so that naona hata siku hizi wana fight for their rights ( Ronald chuckles ) . label='high distance 'Wanataka kukuwa recognized . Do you think that is the reason ?
Mhh … I really do n't think language … ndio imefanya kukawa na - those change in culture . Okay , others , wanataka waki- wakishaanza kuongea English , maybe they 'll start adopting the Western culture , but not all of them . I can n't really blame the English language for homosexuality in Kenya . I can n't blame English for lesbianism . So I think it is the person , the values of the person ndio ime- imemfanya sa ' aka- aka- aka adopt that , uhm , that sexual orientation . But it 's not really the language because uta find kuna wengine hawaongei English , lakini wameona kwa movies , uh , these uh- these people doing this , and they also want to do the same way . But I can n't really blame language for that .
So , you 've mentioned media . So media come in .
Yeah , media comes in .
So inaonekana media then it has a big role to play in influencing people to change their attitudes ama behavior , ama their perception towards something .
Yes . It is the media .
Mhh .
Tunataka kuwa kama wao . Because you see this superstar anafanya hivi and he gets away with it . Maybe he goes and he robs a bank , anapata hiyo pesa yake . He goes on to live a really good life which you aire . Everybody loves money . So utaona pia , " I can do the same thing . " Violence . Unaona violence has a reward . It is the only the- the mode of communication that is used there . English is mainly used in movies . But I can n't say it is because amesikiza in English , ndio ikamfanya a adopt that behavior . What if it was in Swahili ? Or what if it was in Kalenjin maybe ? And still bado iko na violence . Definitely the person will pick the behavior or that trait . It is not because it was English ndio sa ' nikaamua I 'll now pick this trait . It 's not language per say to blame , but plays a role in that .
Okay . Sawa . Unaweza sema nini kuhusu language ya watu wa matatu ?
( Laughs ) " Beba , beba , beba , beba ? "
Mhh . Generally .
Ni mbao - ni mbao - yeah , they use uh , Sheng and uh , Swahili . What we term ( smiles)as the common man's language . Ahaaha … So their language , some of them gives language differently from others . Wengine wanatumia language tu , sijui hawafikirii kwanza before they utter what the words ama nini . Most of them are very disrespectful to their customers . But mainly , wanatumia language in a persuasive manner . If they see you carrying luggage , they 'll rush to you and try to sweet talk you , even telling you tutakupunguzia maybe 50 shillings . We 'll deduce this for you or you 'll arrive there safely , our car is fitted with this , it has the latest music , it has a screen . So they try to use language in a persuasive way . But mainly they language they use is Swahili and Sheng .
So , that one defines them as hawa watu wa matatu sasa .
Ukisikia tu wanaongea na that persuasiveness =
utajua tu =
they really sweet talk you .
Na mama wa sokoni ?
Mama wa sokoni pia they are sweet talkers , very much . Kwa sababu wanataka kuuza . But the language they 'll also use Swahili . I think all this depends on their level of education also , because for one to be a matatu guy , inakwambia their level of education . Ni some were in high school , ama primary . Ule mama wa mboga pia ... dictates something . Kama level lake la education lingekuwa higher maybe even up to tertiary level in college , hangekuwa anauza mboga hapo . Angekuwa anafanya something extra . Angekuwa hata anafanya kazi ya ... maybe hako kwa duka anauza . So it 's their- their level of education ndio imewapatia that- that kind of job . Though not for all of them , but most of them , their level of education is jsut somewhere down there .
Okay .
So they are more conversant with Swahili , which is the language used commonly . And that 's what they 'll use .
Mhh .
Mhh .
Saa tukimalizia . Do you think there can never be a society without language ?
I do n't know . ( Laughs ) Language is used for communication . So I wonder how people will- will even get along without communicating . Even if it is using signs , signs stills are- signs are language . But sign language is not as effective as the verbal language . So a society without language is just dead .
Okay .
It is dead , yeah . How will I t- how will I call for help from someone without using language ? How will I- I mean , it 's everything . Language is just everything . It so defines us .
So it 's very important .
It 's very important .
Ha , asante sana kwa muda wako .
Mhh . Thank you .
