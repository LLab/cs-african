So what-what kind of language do you use your-with your family?,,,,,,,,
,,Fred,,"With my family? With my family, aah <Swahili>inaringana ni nani</Swahili> in my family. Yea my-for example when with my brother we can speak in English. But with my mom most it is Dholuo. Then with my sister in school we also speak maybe Kiswahili or English so majorly it depends on who is speaking. But then, mm let’s say with my dad. My dad mostly is someone who does not want us to speak with him these other languages that we learnt at school. <Swahili label='refereeing'>Tunataka tukiongea tunaongea ile lugha ambae ye ali-alijuwa akizaliwa</Swahili label='refereeing'> and that is the native language that is his father and mother’s language that is Dholuo.  My dad would never speak to you in any other language. Whether he knows it or not.  Even though he knows English but <Swahili>huwahasemi. Ye hata kama anataka kukuuliza kitu</Swahili> he'll just say, “Okello come here” <Swahili>na akuulize, hi ni hivi</Swahili> but it’s just in your mother tongue. He does not ask in any other language.  ","With my family? With my family, aah <English>it depends on who</English> in my family. Yea my-for example when with my brother we can speak in English.

OLF: I believe Fred switched to Swahili in order to express his respect for his father by using Swahili when talking about his father wanting only Swahili to be spoken to him by his son. Although father is not at the interview, Fred acknowledges his desire in this way.",,,,,,

,,Fred,,"Umm, friends now that’s interesting. My friends we speak and we speak each and every language. Yea. Again friends also, it also depends like let’s say when we are at home I have-I mix a lot with people yea so you find that most of my friends some of them are not learned, <Swahili label='refereeing'>hawajui Kiswahili wala Kiingereza</Swahili label='refereeing'>. But even though Kiswahili at least <Swahili>unapata</Swahili> the <Swahili label='refereeing'>wanajuajua ile kidogo.

OLF: Again although his friends are not around, I believe Fred switches from English to Swahili because he is talking about them and their lack of English skills. Perhaps to say that in English would set him apart from them and he wants to maintain his connection to them.",,,,,,

,,Fred,,Because me as a person I like Kiswahili as a language. So most of the time I like using Kiswahili so that I improve my knowledge in it and also my understanding and how people view. Mostly it's Kiswahili that has been helping me from high ss-from primary to high school to here. So most of the time I like Kiswahili. <Swahili>Hata</Swahili> let’s say we are in a formal setup and people are doing introductions.

,,Interviewer,,You just love Swahili.,You just love Swahili.,,,,,,,,
,,Fred,,"Yea and then my love for Kiswahili began in primary school where we had a teacher known as Mr. Henry Lanana.  And that was the best teacher I've ever had in fact all through to a university <Swahili>sijawaiona mwalimu anafundisha kama yeye</Swahili>. Cuz when you came-when he came to class he used to start with us on aah-with a <Swahili>methali</Swahili>, he’d write <Swahili>methali</Swahili> on the board, first what it means, reads a story about that <Swahili>methali</Swahili>, then after that he goes an-how this now how the [uncertain transcription], he’ll tell you what it means, then how-eeh-aah-how you can apply it. So you see that from there we developed an interest in the Swahili language. So from there he just used to go on until the time-I think there’s a time that Walla bin Walla, this famous writer, author in Swahili primary books, Kiswahili moved-came to school and you see by then we were in Class Seven and we were not allowed to go. So it was only meant for the Class Eight. But being that we had that interest in Swahili the head teacher mmmm took eight of us from Class Seven and we went to [uncertain transcription] and you see, in fact that also boosted my interest-my interest in Swahili language because when I went there I saw the man and that the one I'd been longing to see <Swahili label='quotation'>ati “eh! huyu mtu si ako na Kiswahili poa. Ninatamani kumuona”</Swahili label='quotation'>. (they both laugh) So <Swahili>ile</Swahili> time <Swahili>tulienda huko na nikamuona</Swahili> and I asked him a question <Swahili>yani</Swahili> we-we talked one on one…when that question time came, eeh you could-you can just raise your hand and then you ask something and they answer so you see through that my interest in Swahili language developed and from there I said <Swahili>""hata mimi mbona nisikuwe kama yeye?""</Swahili>","Yea and then my love for Kiswahili began in primary school where we had a teacher known as Mr. Henry Lanana.

,The Importance of Knowing Native Languages,Interviewer,00:05:38mins,Okay. And do you think it is important to know your native language?,Okay. And do you think it is important to know your native language?,,,,,,,,
,,Fred,,"That is very important.  He!  Native language, you-remember the saying <Swahili label='quotation'>“mwachamila ni mtumwa”</Swahili label='quotation'>. He who leaves his cultural values is just more of a slave. So I think knowing the native language is important even though I don’t have so many things to say about it but I think it’s very important because first, when someone knows his language-you see you have to know your origin. Yea. <Swahili>Mtu akishajua mahali anatoka</Swahili>, at least you can-it is very easily you can-you can identify that aah this one comes from here. Like I think that matter of <Swahili>mtu kujua</Swahili> origin <Swahili>yake.  Kuna</Swahili> movie <Swahili>nilikuwa naona</Swahili>. And you see in that movie there’s-these Nigerian movies, these common, common Nigerian movies. One that there’s a man who wanted to marry. So this man loves the lady and you see, now when it reached a moment that now the parents proposed that they want to go and know that lady at least they know where she-the lady comes from, that’s when the man mm broke it to them that this lady was an orphan, in fact from an orphanage.

,,Fred (cont.),,"The mother gave birth to her, threw her, some good samaritans picked her up <Swahili>kisha wakampeleka hapo kwa</Swahili> orphanage <Swahili>wakakaakaa kakaakaa</Swahili> then when she was old enough now she decided to leave the orphanage and that’s where they met with that man.  So you see, the problem comes in when now this man want to marry the girl. The man has fallen in love with the girl now, but the parents of the man now they are not consenting to that marriage and even the-the villagers, that is the-those people that can call his fathers they are not happy with that because they said how-how do you marry someone without a background? <Swahili label='elaboration'>Mtu ambaye hata hajui kwao ni wapi?

,,Fred,,"Exactly.  Okay. <Swahili>Itakuwa ita-inachipukachipuka kila siku kama</Swahili> for example if you-<Swahili>kitambo</Swahili> when I was in high-in primary <Swahili>unaona hii mbuyu ilikuwa hiko mingi sana. Mtu anaichambua eti</Swahili>dad <Swahili>sasa ni ""mbuyu"". Kisha ukiangalia huyu mbuyu</Swahili> [uncertain transcription] and that elder came and told us <Swahili>mbuyu ni mti mkubwa</Swahili>. Eh so when the-these people are saying <Swahili>yani</Swahili> they are now comparing maybe the power of the dad in the family <Swahili>yani</Swahili> someone who is powerful like that <Swahili>mbuyu. Si unaona wanasema</Swahili> like there are certain birds that stay in that <Swahili>mbuyu. Ndio maana kuna methali ikaja ati ""mti mkuu ukigwa wana wa nyuni kuyumba yumba"".   Yani</Swahili> there were now comparing that-mm <Swahili>baba</Swahili> to be now a tree so that whenever that people when they say that <Swahili>baba</Swahili> is [uncertain transcription] <Swahili>hako kwa nyumba</Swahili> see the home- home <Swahili>haitakuwa inaendelea ilivyokuwa inaenda. Kisha hii ""demu"", si ""demu"" pia ni jina ya mtu</Swahili> but ""demu"" means <Swahili>kitambaa-kitambaa</Swahili> but <Swahili>kile kime chanikachanika kimechakaa chakaa</Swahili> which means now according to the way Walla was explaining to us he told us that now you see where now boys <Swahili>ama vijanaa</Swahili> they used to refer girl to a ""demu"" which means something that they just use-use it and leave it there. Eh? <Swahili>Kisha ""masa"". ""Masa"" si ni makosa</Swahili>. They say-ah when they say ""masa"" <Swahili>yani</Swahili> that is mom but in Kiswahili ""masa"" means <Swahili>makosa</Swahili>. So you see that one <Swahili>alikuwa anatueleza ati</Swahili> people <Swahili>yani</Swahili> being that parents, that especially the mother that they like now, mm, they-they like disciplining you.  So you see people they use-they just produce a word according to how they associate the old word-according to certain characteristics. Yea, like that ""masa"" now cuz <Swahili>huyu mtu huwa kilawakati ukiwanakosa anakuchapa sasa anaona tusimuite masa na yeye</Swahili>. (laughs)","Exactly.  Okay. <English>It will be sprouting every day like</English> for example if you-<English>a while ago</English> when I was in high-in primary <English>you see, this ""mbuyu""* [word] was there a lot. A person deconstructs it that</English>dad <English>now is  ""mbuyu"". Then when you look at this ""mbuyu""</English> [uncertain transcription] and that elder came and told us <English>""mbuyu"" is a big tree</English>. Eh so when the-these people are saying <English>that is to say</English> they are now comparing maybe the power of the dad in the family <English>that is to say</English> someone who is powerful like that <English>mbuyu.  You see they say that</English> like there are certain birds that stay in that <English>mbuyu. That is why there is a proverb that came saying that ""when a big tree falls, the birds that live on it will be unstable"".  That is to say</English> there were now comparing that-mm <English>father</English> to be now a tree so that whenever that people when they say that <English>father</English> is [uncertain transcription] <English>is not at home</English> see the home- home <English>will not continue on the way it was going. Then this ""demu"", is it not that ""demu"" is also a name for a person</English> but ""demu"" means <English>a piece of cloth-cloth</English> but <English>that which has tattered, is haggard</English> which means now according to the way Walla was explaining to us he told us that now you see where now boys <English>or the youth</English> they used to refer girl to a ""demu"" which means something that they just use-use it and leave it there. Eh? <English>Then ""masa"". ""Masa"" is it not sin.</English>. They say-ah when they say ""masa"" <English>that is to say</Englishi> that is mom but in Kiswahili ""masa"" means <English>sin</English>. So you see that one <English>was explaining to us that</Englishi> people <English>that is to say</English> being that parents, that especially the mother that they like now, mm, they-they like disciplining you.  So you see people they use-they just produce a word according to how they associate the old word-according to certain characteristics. Yea, like that ""masa"" now cuz <English>this person usually everytime you have erred she spanks you now he sees should we not call her sin as well</English>. (laughs)",CS,"*Mbuyu is a baobab tree.
