Thank you for your time for making time to be with me for this converasation and language use .
I have undersand .
Yah , tell me what language do you specifially do use with your family .
My family being that I am a Mgiriama ( tribe ) I usually use Kigiriama(Languege ) yah , that is Kimijikenda .
So that is , you would be using that with your parents
Yah , ( agree ) mostly , mostly my mum but mosty when am with dad I often use Swahili .
Why , why use Kigiriama with mum and then your father Swahili .
We have been brought up like that … (interrupted )
Are they both , are they both Giriamas ?
Yah ( agree ) all of them , eeeh ! so we have are brought up like that we are used talking with dad Swahili he use Kigiriama but most of the time he use Swahili or English and then mum mum often use native language .
And brothers , sisters what do you use .
Brothers Kigiriama .
Kigiriama Eeeh , you use Swahili with your dad but Kigiriama with them .
Yes , and mostly brothers we use Kigiriama eeh ! Yah .
Ok , and those friends at home .
Friends at home , Swahili .
Any English at all .
Eeeh ( agree ) a bit .
A bit .
Those maybe who are educated a little bit maybe I will use English sometimes here and there .
They are those who are at home often .
They will see it 's only often at home mostly it ’s Swahili or Kigiriama eeh .
So that area is for the Giriama .
As in like where I live in Lamu(place ) we live with Muslims but still there are Giriama around yah .
And those Muslims what do you use with them coz am sure you have some Swahili friend .
We use … (interrupted ) most of them by the way they are now Muslims we use Swahili more often .
And your Swahili and theirs , is it the same Swahili or is it different .
It 's different as in like me that Swahili I often use now is different with that I use at home . If it 's at home , we use Kibajuni ( native dialect ) . ( both laugh ) .
Bajuni is now a dialect on Swahili , and what about for here or this is for country ?
Yah ( agree ) this is for country we can say this is for country like here maybe you will use some Slang here and there English here and there but if it 's at home that community …. ( interrupted )
So you understand Slang .
I do n't know Slang that much but since coming here I have learned others eeh ! But when I am at home I often mostly use if maybe I relate with others , that community that have suround us called Wabajuni eeh ! now I use their Bajuni I often use Kibajuni .
So you are fluent in Kibajuni .
Yah ( agree ) I can speak kibajuni very well .
And with your friends here in school campus .
Here in campus we mostly use Swahili but not the pure Swahili , we use Swahili that has English inside and Sheng inside eeh !
why do you do that ?
Mostly those I talk to speak are used to Slang , now for me from Coast ( place in Kenya near Indian Ocean ) I do n’t Slang that much coz Coast normaly have no Slang .
If it 's Swahili it 's Swahili if it 's English it 's English though English is not that much mostly .
Yes ( agree ) English is not more often . Now when I come here people who I usually relate with them mostly know Slang so I will mix Slang and Swahili even them also as in I will use Swahili pure very much maybe it can give them problem so I have to mix English with Swahili and Slang so that they can understand that we can communicate very well .
Even them also have to mix so that you can understand when they use pure you will understand .
There are others that may pass me .
It can pass ?
So even them understand .
Do you think it 's important to know English ?
Yah . ( agree )
why is it important you are like " yah " you seems you are not sure is it important especially for somebody like coming from Coast where Swahili is everything is it important .
So Swahili is everything there but now when it comes to like reading you will see most of the subjects are in English even you will see even if it 's for Swahili we often see title still is in English .
I have a friend from Coast who told me that they had a nice discussions they usually …. even if it 's a subject of English , Chemistry and what they do it in swahili is it true ?
Yes ( agree ) you can do it in Swahili but you see if there are other things that you can not use Swahili maybe if you discuss something maybe you can use Swahili to talk about something but still they way you will studying you will be reading in English .
Even also writing exams or what , you have to do it in English . So you think it 's important kwasababu ya masomo .
Because of studies and still maybe even you see maybe you can relate with a person from abroad eeeh ! if you know maybe Swahili only it will be very hard ... ( Interrupted )
Especially at …. ( not clear ) there are a lot of ….. ( not clear )
Eeeh ! ( agree ) so there as in people also study English a bit at list so that you can relate with people , somebody who does n't know Swahili and then if also maybe there are like these many jobs that are found mostly here in that language used is mostly English so at list it 's a must that you are secured with job .
But There are those jobs also Swahili is enough and you get along .
Eeeh ! ( agree ) but at list you must be secured not you only singline if I am doing media say I will go broadcast Swahili , I must have a clue of Swahili and English .
Say maybe am hired in Radio Bahari or Radio … What do we call ... ( interrupted )
Pwani Fm .
Do you need English .
You do n't need , but you will need maybe when you are working but there are people maybe they are coming to an office still want to relate with them and maybe they do n't know Swahili now you must be knowing English yah .
And mother tounge ? do you think it is important for anyone to know that .
Heh ! That is a must … (both laugh )
That is a must Kigiriama is a must .
I must know Kigiriama .
Why why
First , to be identified like a Giriama maybe when I go somewhere when I talk Kigiriama when I talk Kigiriama people will know this is a Giriama , and aslo at list when I go back home I wo n't be left out maybe you will find people talking Kingiriama with me maybe I do n't know Kigiriama and I call myself a Giriama .
But they know Swahili they can also talk Swahili and understand .
But maybe not all know Swahili you see when you go deep rural village then meet with old grandmothers you will get to know they do n't know Swahili , they are learning Swahili so mostly they use Kigiriama so you wo n't understand .
Eeeh ( agree ) There are others here who does n't know Swahili lets say like that community of the Bajuni community their Swahili is obvious they know Swahili but upate like Pokomo , Mgiriama , Mtaita you will find others who do n't know Swahili .
So Mijikenda is like , what is it a language or it 's like community .. ( not clear )
Mijikenda is a community and then inside has tribes .
Giriama , Pokomo … (interrupted )
Aaah .. ( disagree ) the Pokomo is different eeh .. like Coastal bantus there are three , the Wamijikenda , Wataita , and Wapokoma but still so them have kept as in those Muslims because Swahili came after , orginally it was them three but then after them Arabs came there thats how Swahili came up .
Now within the Mijikenda group which are this tribes .
We have the Wagiriama , we have Wajibana … (Interrupted )
Dominant Wagirima ..
Eeeeh ( agree ) Wagiriama Now those are many .
And what had you said .
Wajibana .
Wajibana , I do n’t know them .
There is wachoni , Wandigo .
And do you understand each other linguistically ?
Eeeeh ( agree ) When they talk although as in different meaning there is different it 's very few like us we call mother " mama " when it 's the Taita they will call it " mayo " but still we understand each other in many things so if Mchoni ( tribe ) comes here and talk I will not miss anything eeh .
And when he/she speaks Kigiriama is there anything that he /she will miss .
No he/she will understand everthing that I will say .
Therefore so we can have one …. ( both laugh ) .. which is the Chonyi just choose the Chonyi that speaks the Chonyi it 's same or you want Kigirama .
Like now for me I am used to Kigiriama very much I can hear Kichoni ( native language ) but maybe there are small names that I know but I can n't the way they talk eeh now where I am born at the Giriama is what I know very much completely .
You are very fluent nothing will pass you .
No .
Even if I live here for the next ten , twenty years .
I do n’t think I can forget for the time been since when I was young have been brough up at the Giriama and I hear Kigiriama been spoken I learned Kigiriama you see now .
Are there other Giriama here in campus .
There are there but not many but …. ( interrupted )
Do you always speak in Kigirama when you meet or they show-off very much or they do n’t know Kigiriama .
( Laugh ) Aahh . ( disagree ) When I meet with them we talk in Kigiriama eeeh we always speak in Kigiriama .
Ok , but mostly Do you here use Slang Swahili or Kigiriama or English .
Eeeh ( agree ) but here meaning that at other parts different different maybe I have meet Jaluo I have meet with a Kalenjin that 's when I will use that but mostly when I meet with a Giriama or any Mijikenda we will talk in a Mijikenda so that I can feel at list I remember ooh .. ( both laugh )
I have heard that so many people from Coast have problem with English is it true or is it just a steriotype .
( laughter) … Eeeh ( agree ) it 's true yah .
What do you think it causes that ?
First it 's ignorance mostly people from Coast English is not mostly valued and then where you are born from community that speak mostly Swahili now a person learn more Swahili more than English eeeh .
But when we compare if those lets say Luhya anybody from this side of the country since they also grow up in a community where their mother toungue is spoken or whatever other language but when you come to campus when you compare their performance of English with those from Coast still are above why ?.
Performance of English of people in the country and Coast , like the way I said Coast English as in not valued that much .
Therefore people see like Swahili is more prestigious .
Eeeh ( agree ) as in like there Swahili as in Swahili more considerate than English and then as in they see as if English is something very hard before somebody get 's it .
And if they get somebody from there who does n't have .... ( hesistate ) speaks English very fluent very much a very good English what do they think about that person .
As in mostly you can be taken as if you are showing off maybe lets say you go soemwhere like here then start speaking in English now " this one now " ( both laugh ) they are often taken like a person is howing off he/she is educated ... ( interrupted )
Not like you have admired when often say heee ! He/she wants to be like that person .
Aaah ( disagree ) if maybe is a person maybe somebody is from maybe here and go there so that maybe you can now say heee ! ... ( interruped )
I am saying the onw from there .
From there , you wil see as if you are showing off mostly you will be seen as you want to show off eeh .
Do you mix languages in a conversation .
Eeeh ( agree ) like me I do , I do mostly I mix Kiswahili I with with English and some Sheng .
When do you do that .
Mostly when I am with my friends from here in campus mostly the use Swahili and English and Slang a bit when I go home if I am talking with my mother I mix Swahili and Giriama and maybe my friends from home I will mix Swahili and English mostly ..
Sometimes you can just talk maybe you find a name that is hard name that is hard maybe if it 's Swahili maybe it 's hard to identify you are forced to say in English if it 's easy or if maybe like if English is hard you speak in Swahili and then maybe when you are somewhere like maybe it 's somebody lets say if am talking to somebody and who does n't Swahili that much so I will use maybe if there is a term that can give him/her a problem I will use Swahili so that he/she can understand or I 'll use English so that she/he can understand better .
Apart from that any other reason .
Reason as to why I mix languages ?
Mix Languages .
Am used to … (interrupted )
You are used to it it 's just part of your nature
Yah ( agree ) am used mostly .
Do you notice any diffrence between the way you talk and the way others talk .
The way I talk .. ( interrupted )
The way you speak , talk and the way other students talk .
As in like me people , there is like as in everybody has it 's own way of using the language like me now I like using certain term other people do not like using it you see if maybe I have my accent other person has a diffrent accent so you see there is difference between me and the other person if maybe I like talking in Swahili I like talking in English different to another person so mostly there is diffrence yah between one another in regards on how they talk .
And when you are in a room and then somebody passes by outside and knows that is Silvia then say " Silvia "
Mostly people have known me to be loud when I talk I am loud and then it 's …. ( interrupted )
That ’s true because when in class I know when Silvia talks " Silvia or something .
Eeeh ( agree ) am loud and then Most often when I am here I often like as in I do n't want to forget so I often use accent of there you will see maybe I have talked with accent of Mombasa so someone can now know .
And there is that accent You can say it 's accent from the country .
Eeeeh ( agree ) there is .
Is it the same for everybody or there is accent same
Mostly I see there is same accent from country everybody is have that accent but when you go to Coast you will find them also have their accent now you see when someone from Coast talks with someone from the country talks you will know this person is from the country and this is one is from Coast according to the their accent the way they will be talking .
And what about the choice of words they use is it also possible apart from the accent .
Choice of words eeeh ( agree ) maybe you will find someone from Coast has a certain term which they like to use and you will see people from country like to use " as in , coz , what " there are these names of English which they like to use that 's common to use but someone from Coast would be hard to find he/she mix word like them you will see maybe either use Swahili or English but rarely he/she will add English use Swahili that 's pure very much so you will know this person is from country they way the words that he/she chooses .
So you are saying it 's possible to know this person is from country or if from Coast they way with how they .. ( interrupted )
The way he/she talks also his/her choice of words mmmh .
It 's possible to do that , and also is it possible if people are from country both of them are from Country to tell this person is from this part of country …. ( not clear )
Still it 's possible still it comes with the accent maybe you will find if like Kikuyu has come here and Kamba you will find a Kamba have it 's accent of Kamba .
And if he/she has . ( not clear) … will you know the difference .
Because you see even Coast is not like we as in Coast still there are these tribes that come from country still so we interact with them .
But many of them will end up picking Swahili for there but … still you will know .
Eeeeh ( agree ) still you will know if maybe when they talk I will know if this is a Kamba or this is a Kikuyu or this is Jaluo .
And those who are there .
As in those who are brought up there ?
Eeeeh !
Hee ! that is hard there is another lady I met here now when we were talking she as in I was passing by when she spoke I knew this person is from Coast so I went to greet her but then I was suprised she is not from those tribes of Coast she told me she is a Luo , she have just stayed in Coast for three years but she is completely changed her Swahili until when you hear her nowdays talking , she talks with an accent from there very much .
So it becomes hard .
So it becomes hard , it depends by the way environment which you are brought up with it will determine the way you will talk eeh .
Ok , lets say somebody is talking somewhere and you do n't see her , I said Silvia is in a room and the she talks , is it possible to tell their background from the way they are talking without you seeing them anything about their background is it possible .
You can have a clue of it .
What things about the background for example .
Maybe mostly you can maybe tribe , mostly you can know tribe , tribe where he/she is from or where he/she is from if maybe , it depends with his/her choice of words if hat person is from Nyeri as in it will tell you if this person is from which tribe mostly so those words and the accent that he/she will have so that can make you know where this person is from and where that person belongs .
So you can tell . What about things like level of education of somebody from the way they talk is it possible to tell that this person is educated or not educated .
Eeeeh ( agree ) but that is not that much but still you can , you can mostly with the his/her choice of words maybe if she/he will be using vocabularies or hard idioms you will know this person either if maybe this person speaks Swahili very much that is pure and uses maybe Idioms or hard vocabularies you will know this person maybe study Swahili or studied Swahili for long or capable to meet somebody who can talk English fluent very much eeh you will know this person maybe as in have majored in English as in he is learned eeh you will know .
But you can find the one who is from class eight but was very in English .
Now you see a person like that maybe he/she drop but still maybe he or she was good in English but then when he/she drop out still continued to learn English so you will know this person studied that English untill he/she know very much .
Position of somebody in the society .
Position according to how you talk eeh I do n't think , I do n’t think if … (interrupted )
Can you know if this is a somebody like president or this other person is vice president or this other person is a village elder or common citizen is it possible .
Common citizen ( laughter ) maybe choice of words maybe you will find president using those terms he/she is is used to since been in the office so the choice of words is maybe can give you clue this person have which positon or holding which post somewhere now choice of words mostly can tell you the post of a person .
What about political affiliation of somebody from the way they speak like when you are in campus and then there students off course like elections were on the other day so the way somebody speaks and you just know this person must be on the Cord ( " Coalition of Reformed Party " Name of political party ) this is amust is it possible .
Eeeeh ( agree ) by the way If somebody support a certain party you will see the way he/she talks maybe he/she talks in a way deffending that party mostly and then other people often use tribe to , to as in to associate with certain party or maybe when you get a Kikuyu you will this one obvious is suppoting TNA ( " The Natinal Alliance Party " Name of a political party ) or when you get a Luo you will say obvious is supporting CORD ( " Coalition of Reformed Party " Name of political party ) but that is just judgment of somebody but mostly you will see the way somebody is talking eeh he/she will be maybe you are supporting or you oppose certain that will show you the political that belongs .
Do you speak different languages to different people .
Different language as in ?
Because you have told me you know giriama do you know English which other language do you know apart from the three , Kibajuni .
As in ahh … (interrupted )
You know several languages so do you speak these different languags to different people .
Eeeeh ( agree ) I do .
What motivate that to why do you do that .
For example maybe if the formal conversation as in like maybe the language that I am surppose to use is Swahili I use Swahili I will make sure I have n't mix anything and then if maybe it 's a place that I am to speak in English only I will use English mostly and then like maybe when am gone home and meet with a person maybe a giriama and then maybe it 's a person who does n't know these other languages so mostly I will use giriama or maybe I get somebody who is a Swahili who knows mostly Swahili I will use Swahili only yah .
So depending on the context with who you are talking to .
Eeeh ! who am talking to the main context yah that will determine which language I will use yah .
Have you ever try to change the way you talk or anything about the way you talk .
Eeeeh ( agree ) like me I do mostly I do change like when I am in Coast you will see me using accent for there like me now when I leave here now and go there maybe day there first day is when somebody will say I arrived today but after staying two days I will have adapt when I come here I will have change as in maybe the first one the way I am used there I will come here then the following day or after maybe even two to three days I will have adapt .
How do you do that .
As in for example when I leave here and go home I normaly like as in put myself same as other people I do n't want maybe them to see " this one has come from there and come here with Slang " eeh I am from country I do n't know what so mostly I use girima and then the way people will be talking I will be talking differently I will see like eeh ! there is a way that I am doing wrong as in I will see like people are seeing me like I dont't belong there or I will just feel not good so I will talk to them the way how they are talking .
And when you are here .
And when I also come here when I also start speaking in Swahili maybe for there maybe they will say " eeh this one or this one has lots of Swahili " now when I come here I will talk same like them so that I wo n't feel awkward I am talking different from other people now I always want to interact with people at the same level .
So you always feel the guilt too to fit in .
Yah ( agree ) to fit in , in any conversation if am talking with person I feel that as in they wo n't feel is I maybe I not from here or I am very different yah .
And your lectures how do you , what language do you use with them .
Mostly English yah .
That will be the same English that you would use with your friends .
No .
You change again to which kind of English .
Maybe to pure English I will just speak in English very much but if it 's not ok the way I talk with my other certain friends my English but like ni lecture I will use either if I have decided it 's Swahili I will use Swahili I will use Swahili and if it 's English and first I said it depends with the formality of that converstion if it 's formal I will use just if it 's Swahili , Swahili and if it 's English , English in informal converstion I mix all language yah .
Now this time what are the issues you are discusing with you and your friends what are the issues that are most discused .
Like now discussion is to go home … (both laugh )
People have missed home very much .
Eeeeh ( agree ) That 's when you will see us mostly about going home the way somebody have miss home and as in I talk mostly about the negative about school the way school have bored you or the way school has done to you eeh mostly we will just talk like that the way we are almost going home yah .
What else ok what about when almost gone home semester is in the middle somewhere there what would you be talking relaxing in the hostel over the weekend .
Well topic just come sometimes you will find maybe we are talking about course which we are doing we start to plan future lives or we start to … (interrupted )
You are already planning future life at first year .
Eeeeh ( agree ) ( laugh ) we start talking how maybe you will want to do when you leave here where will go what will you do yah .
Like you now what do you want to do when you finish .
Now like me first when I leave here I want to join any local radio station to get experience then after that is when iI start looking for these major industries these big big .
Now the local radio station you mean those one for Pwani .
Eeeeh ( agree ) Even if it 's not for Pwani but these eeh mostly I will go the one that is either it will use Swahili or English or maybe I go that it broadcast as in it airs it 's things in Giriam or Mijikenda like there in Coast there is now maybe …. ( interrupted )
Therefore when you are been listened in radio when you speak in Girima people will say this is a Giriama .
Eeeeh ( agree ) they will know it mgiriama .
They will not say hey ! This even …. ( not clear )
Aaaah I will speak in Giriama only that maybe there are those hard hard terms that maybe I do n't know but I will speak that Giriama normal that everyone understand and one will know this is a Giriama only that I wont use those hard hard terms eeh .
Have you ever been on radio .
Yah ( agree ) here in MU FM ( Moi University radio ) and then there at home also there is certain local radio station that I was in there .
what were you doing .
Like here MU sometimes I always go for news I always go for news maybe some certain programs .
In which language .
Swahili and English .
You can read news in both Swahili and English .
Yah ( agree ) I can read Swahili and English .

Is there I can listen to it hear now is it on now or what time actally .
Yah ( agree ) it 's on now this is always week days there on from Monday to Friday yah .
Do you still listen to MU FM .
Some do but some always say that it 's boring they do n't listen they say those who are intrested listen now like me that I am used maybe going there sometimes you will see me in the evening maybe listening in my room yah .
And are you enjoing . But you also think there are a lot to things to be improved .
Yah ( agree ) there are a lot of things by the way mmh ! It has to be improved first by the way it ’s just a radio station for student that is as in for . .. ( interrupted )
That level two for student to help to come-up so for that role you think it ’s working well for you to get an exposure how to … (incomplite )
Like me I use to have problem when I came here as in as in if it 's news I will first tense before and now you will see maybe I can miss here and there but now am used to for the time been .
Even radio people tense coz I thought you tense where you feel people are looking at you .
But you know that you are being listened to , there are people listening so you can be tensed when gone there or maybe go like this to studio airing and you are with many people surounding you there looking at you we will come see you while on air maybe there is certain program in progress so maybe if it 's news they want then when they are done is when they can contunue still there will be people inside , and then who maybe supervising you until maybe you can be scared .
Now if am planning to come to Lamu what will I see in Lamu what is the most striking thing .
Lamu mostly boats ( both laughs ) that ’s the first thing .
I fear water by the way sana I have a phobia towards … I can n't swim .
Water is not bad .
I am sure you you can swim .
I can yah I do swim .
So you go to the beach swimming when you are at home .
Now maybe like you go to Lamu now the first thing to see is boat because you will get there you cannot get to Lamu Island when you have not board a boat so you will board a boat so you will board a boat so that you can get to lamu Island and the when you get to Lamu Island you will start to see black people as in black I mean hijab many people ... ( both laugh )
But you are a christian .
Eeeeh ( agree ) I am a christian .
That 's why you do n’t wear hijab so the majority there are … (interrupted )
I am a christian ... it 's muslims though you will see maybe people who live there becomes muslims you will be out even if you are another tribe not a muslim but when you get there you will be influenced there is a way they like to infuence influence people until you become a muslim .
How dot they do that ?
Maybe they shield you mostly maybe as in when maybe they will call you and tell you this and that they will take you to a mosque and then they start to …. ( interrupted )
Have you gone to a mosque .
Aaah ( disagree ) I have never entered a mosque As in they will start to trite you nicely .
They want to change you to be a muslim .
They usually like to get that number , number to be big they will trite you nicely like a sister thier 's is what , what yao nini nini then will come and tell you " surely can you just be a muslim I do n't know what " then will tell you many things about muslim .
And the Lamu cultural festival have you ever attended .
Eeeeh ( agree ) have been there every festival last year but I think ... ( interrupted )
Have always want to come to that festival maybe one day I will come I heard people do donkey racing .
For donkey eeeh it 's just they usually celebrate culture of Lamu mostly Lamu does n’t have means of transport is donkey .
Have you ride a donkey .

Come to Lamu ride a donkey you will see as in donkey maybe it will have been decorated when you ride you see you have ride a horse but it 's a donkey ( both laugh ) .
But it 's better to ride a donkey the the ... the other one is called Camel .
Camel , camel are also in Lamu but a few .
But they are not actually … (interrupted )
Eeeeh ( agree ) not many as in you will find there are people using it for bussiness maybe you are gone to a beach you find or three Camels and it 's mostly there because they want bussiness maybe when they ride a person is paid so it 's just a matter of bussiness .
Ok thank you for your time .
Ok thank you , you are welcome .
