 Yes, you feel that you have so many ways of expressing yourself. If I lack the English I can use my Kiswahili. If I lack my Kiswahili and I go to a situation whereby I see people are Kalenjin speakers, and I need something from there, I will have to go and speak that Kalenjin. Actually conversational language is supposed to help you attain something, it's not just "there's a flower". Yea, it is for some purpose, to acquire something. Transactional, not just to inform me. So if I need something: <Unknown Language>"Kona!<Unknown Language> Give me! <Swahili label='quotation'>Nipe!</Swahili label='quotation'>" Yes, {I'll have} acquired whatever it is that is needed.
