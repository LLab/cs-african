We are talking about language and language use yah .. And may be just to ask , when you are with your family , which language do you tipically use ?
Most of the times we use Kiwahili , yah .. at home , as a family we communicate in Kiswahili that is the language am used to at home yah ..
Maybe for what other reasons do you use Kiswahili and not English then or ..?
Ok .. Well .. uh .. ahh ! I just grown up speaking in Kiswahili at home , but uh .. at times my mother used to speak to me in kikuyu and then I respond in Kiswahili because personally I did n’t know Kikuyu , at list I try to know abit of it . I did n’t know but my dad does n't know Kikuyu so , he communicates in Kiswahili . Ok English ile labda once in a while yah .. but the dominate language that we used is Swahili .
Aawa , ni kwasababu wote mnaelewa Swahili ?
Yah ( agree ) It 's because all of us understand kiswahili and we are very confortable with it . Yah ..
Hiyo ni nziri , Na mkiwa na marafiki ?
Ok when am with my friends , it depends what kind of friends kuna wale formal and informal friends . My formal friends ile yani official business speaking English maybe abit of Kiswahili lakini informal friends are the once am used to , we will speak maybe Sheng , Kiswahili yah ..
Ok , now while here in school ? You speak the same ?
Yah ( agree ) pia hapa shule yani it depends , there are some people you speak to them in English , official English , the others you speak to them in Swahili nakuna wengine as in utamix tu , nabonga na wao sheng .
Ok .. So maybe what makes you choose the language to specific kind of people ?
Ok , according to me , inadepend na attitude yenye niko nayo towards that person , and the way that person speaks to me , if you show me you are very formal in English I will respond that way kama unaniongelesa sheng " hi Waledi niaje ? " that is how I will respond . yah ! so inadepend yah .
English , do you think it is important for one to know ?
Yah ( agree ) , It is important to know , the reason been , which we are using in school kwanza most importantly , it is the formal language , business as in any job you need to be good in English , so I tend to think that it is important , very very important .
How about , you talked of , you understanding Kikuyu that been , Supposetly your native language do you think it is important for one to know a native language ?
Yah ( agree ) it is important for people to understand their native languages , because they tend to think , how do you identify yourself with a certain when … maybe what is your nationality ? Am a kenyan . Which part of kenya do you come from ? I come from Central Kenya . As in , what makes me .. uh ! as in what make identify mayself with people from central Kenya , is it just because am born there ? no . what do i have to show other people . And what makes me diffrent from people from , Coast and other places I think sasa hapo ndio native language becomes important .
Wale watu ambao hawana native language maybe , do you think they are missing something ?
Yah ( agree ) actually they are missing something kwasababu when you are talking about English Kiswahili kuna original owners wa these languages kama English ni ya wazungu , Kiswahili ni ya waswahili What about yours ? as wewe umesoma foreign language mbona hawa wajesoma yako ? as much as , I think you have to be proud of your native language and you have to learn it . Yah they are missing something they are missing alot . The sense of identity because if you tell somebody I am a kikuyu or I am a Kalenjin and you do n't know how to speak in Kalenjin you just know how to speak English and Kiswahili it shows even you are not even proud of yourself , of you ahh origin . Yah , so it is important
Sasa umesema unaweza kuongea lugha kama tatu hivi ? Kikuyu , Kingeresa , Kiswahili , ushajipata ukimix this languages ? Maybe in one conversation ?
Yah ( agree ) it is normal as in you you just find yourself mixing languages
Maybe when and why do you mix ?
Most of the time hiyo hukuja naturally as in when you are speaking sometimes maybe you are used to a certain slogan maybe in English . Like now I have a problem as in every time I use that " as in " I just realize that from my friends every time > nikiongea as in maybe hata kama ninaongea Kiswahili , natumia hiyo as in . You just mix naturally na pia sometimes there are certain words maybe you are speaking in English and then a word does not click sasa unamix yah , that is what happens most of the times .
Ok .
Yah ( agree ) pia it 's fun .
It 's fun mixing languages ? Yah .
Very fun yah interesting .
Now which languages do you find yourself mixing most ?
Most of the time I mix English and Kiswhili yah .
mmm !! Ok ( long pause )
Ok well I tend to think it is interesting when you are mixing launguages kwanza mostly English na Kiswahili as in it comes naturally and you enjoy it so you find yourself most of the time wanting to mix yah .
Is it because you friends also do that ?
Yah ( agree ) most of my friends also do that yah .
Now in the way you speak do you notice any difference ? Between the way you speak and the way other students talk ?
Yah ( agree ) there is a big difference kwanza accent , people from different areas have different accents kama vile me ujienjoy when my luo friends are talking they have nice English or Swahili and then now you hear the luo accent as in it is fun . Yah people speak diffently yah . mostly I tend to think ni kwa sababu ya penye mtu ametoka .
Ok venye wewe umetoka that place Nyeri do you think you have the accent that identifies you with that place ?
Personally sidhani niko na accent ya Kikuyu and the reason been kwetu sana sana sisi uongea Kiswahili , ndio maana sina hiyo accent , but aah kama my friends , most of them wako nayo ya Kikuyu like aah ! when somebody as in they have a problem with L and R as in wakiongea unaskia L and R , SH and CH yah they have a problem .
Inaonyesha mahali wametoka .
Yah ( agree ) it shows where they come from .
The way they speak ?
mmmh !!
Now you yourself can you identify the fact if somebody was speaking even Swahili or English see they are not speaking their native language can you tell from the way they talk that they come from such and such an area ?
Of course it is very possible , yah when a luo talks from the accent , even if this person is speaking English or Swahili you will know that this is a luo , when a Kikuyu is speaking , whether you speak in English or Swahili na iko na accent , you can tell that this person is a Kikuyu at one time or another . aah place yenye ni ngumu ni watu wenye tuseme kuna watu hawana accent so sometimes it is difficult for you kujua wametoka wapi saa zenye wanaongea yah the speakers who are so good as in kuna watu wenye hawana accent lakini the highest percentage of people wako na accent .
Ni nini maybe hutoa this accent from people ?
I think most of the people at home will communicate with their native language so your mother tounge interference ndio hiyo hufanya as in mtu akuwe na accent na pia kwenye mko kama watu wanakusorround sana kama wewe ni mjaluo you speak kijaka unacheki ni maneno unaskia kila saa so I tend to think hata kusungumza hivyo ndio utasungumsa venye unasikia yah ..
Namm , Na ukiwa unamsikiza mtu , Hujamwona huyo mtu can you tell maybe their level of education , their position in the society from the way they just talk ?
Yah ( agree ) you can aah .., its very possible , according to me , aah .. sometimes aah .. yaani vile mtu anaongea the chioce of words , the level ya vocabulary mtu anatumia unaoana kabisa yenyewe huyu msee ako juu yah kuna venye yah , the way somebody talks anaongea alot about the level of education yah , mtu mwenye ni hivi hivi ok fine mtu mwenye ako down as in hivi hivi anaongea tu hivi hivi so utaunderstand maybe hajesoma sana and stuff somebody who is educated maybe formal , speak good English , nice English , the way he/she arrange the words the vocabulary you know .
Watu husema ati when somebody speaks English you can tell the level of Education na wakiongea Kiswahili kuna vile yani you cannot really tell is that true ?
Well yah ( agree ) unaweza sema hivyo because aah .. kama English you know I think English ni a matter of vocabulary and words , if you are highly educated bana as in I tend to think your level of english inafaa ikuwe si ile common unajua kuna common words people will use na kuna some words people will use bana = hata unaachwa tu hapo ukisikiza .
unaachwa ukii … inaweza tafuta dictionary yako .
So yah , it is true lakini Kiswahili , unajua si watu wengi wanapay much attention to Swahili as in hata mtu anaweza kukuambia amesoma lakini hawezi communicate na Kiswahili vizuri so Swahili by the way ningumu , ningumu hujue place yenye msee amefika , yah .
And the position in the society , can you tell from the way somebody talk ?
Position in the society somehow , somehow unaweza because hawa wasee utend kuwa authoritative ile yaani wakiongea , zile words wana use ni kama authoritative , ordering around according to me , so yah unaweza sema yah .
Na ile ok the political affiliation from the way somebody talks can you tell may be that this person is affiliated to such and such party maybe ?
unajua saa zile unaongea obviously kuna …. ( interruptend )
Kuna maneno you understand ?
Yah(agree ) sasa yani tuseme mimi ni mtu wa Cord ( political party ) , napenda Raila ( Cord party leader ) sana maybe unacheki nitakuwa tu ninamsifu sifu everything ni positive simucriticize So from the way I talk , you can say huyu msee yenyewe ni mtu wa Cord damu unacheki ? yah So I tend to think that aah , from the way a person talks unaweza pick because when it comes to political issues , eeh .. Kenyans are very sensitive bana yah so mtu yaani anapenda kitu na ile passion so hata akiongea yah you can tell from that .
Anajitokeza tu ?
Yah ( agree ) you can tell from that .
Now wewe unaweza sema kwamba unaweza kuongea lugha tofauti kwa watu tofauti ?
Mimi(pause ) ok , fine lugha tofauti interms of what nikiongea na mkikuyu na Kikuyu , nikiongea na …. ama ?
mmm !! Aaah hivo Like ok unaweza , unaenda place , you are talking Kiswahili to somebody all over sudden you meet this person and you like " eeh .. English bana lazima niongee "
Yah ( agree ) It has happen yah .
Maybe in what situations and maybe when ?
Kama mimi hee !! Nikipatana .. Niende school of IS , nipatane na dem mwingine hapa beshe yangu anaitwa Ester ni mkikuyu aah .. Nikipatana na yeye hatakama sijui Kikuyu vizuri yah … (interapted ) Because most of the time you see anapanda kuniongelesha Kikuyu ama as in my kikuyu name ni Shiro , so akiniona ananiambia " niaje Shiro ati Shiro " as in yani ananiongelesha Kikuyu so ata mimi inabidi .. ( interrupted ) yah !! najibu na kikuyu naaza kuongea na Kikuyu . When it comes to , aah ... may friends , most of like muslim friends are from Coast so I switch my Kiswahili to adjust hiyo ya Coast yah .. that is how I do it .. yah nikikutana na beshte yangu Okelo kama ni mjaka Kiswahili changu yani nakitwist naingiza ile accent ya kijaka hata kasina unajua as in to make the environment just conduive .
Ni kwa nini ? Kwa nini mingi ?
Ok .. It is fun , it is intresting and pia you make somebody more comfortable unajua kama tuseme maybe umepatana na mtu and then hamukuwa mnapatana tena kidogo alafu sasa tuseme aonge Kikuyu asikietu unajua hiyo lugha si nikama yani it 's bringing you more closer na inamake ile kuna cool yani yaah .. ( interrupted ) mnapatana zaidi by the way yah .
Now , you admited the fact that you talk diffrently from the way other people speak . Now have you tried to change in any way the way you talk ?
Yah ( agree ) have tried to change …. ( interrupted )
Nani kwasababu gani maybe ?
Kama , ok fine vile naongea maybe English na Kiswahili hapa aaah .. When it comes to , I go to the studio saa zingine When it comes to presenting something lazima nikuwe official , as in I have to use a language that is official so I 'll switch , my English has to be formal my Swahili also has to be formal kwa vivyo lazima ni zungumuze vile inafaa . Pia when it comes to maybe talking to lecturers you just do n't as in vile me ubonga na mabeshe zangu I just can n't talk to them like that . You have to be abit formal yah coz hiyo informality sana ni sazile mko na mabeshe wako So yani aah .. inadepend pia , kama mna discuss class if you are discussing something in class as in you have to be formal you just do n't speak the way unaspeak outside class yah .
Sasa tumesema ukiwa na marafiki wako you are informal . What if you unaamkatu siku moja you are so formal how will these people take you ?
You know it 's abit hard . Ok well according to me it 's abit hard .. ( interrupted ) as in to ..
Hata huwezi anza hata .
Eeh .. Ati niamketu ati mimi leo nianze kuongea English yani formal English kama niko class , aah .. It is hard . Unapata tu … unajua .. as in , wasee ni kama yani you uchukulia kila kitu seriouse hivo , hata hiyo environment ya formality alafu somebody does n't know what you are thinking kama you use to kidding making fun you know as in and then all over sadden you start ile formality wasee wanshindwa what 's wrong with you yah .. ( laughter )
Sawa and talking of your friends , now what issues are you discussing with your friends nowadays ?
Ok , with my friends , we discuss everything or anything that crops up tunaweza discuss politics , marrige , relationship , education , anything that crops up yah . We never plan what to discuss , an issue just comes up and we pick it and we discuss it yah .
You have some issues in mind maybe why do you discuss this issues ?
Ok , I tend to think the issues that affect our lives in one way or another that is why we discuss them . Mmmh .
Ok , so as you said , you do n’t plan on what you talk about .
Yah , we do n’t plan on what to talk about , we just find ourselves talking about anything or something that has crop out or something that 's affecting you directly . We just find ourselves debatng or discussing .
Sasa ni issues zenye zinajitokeza hiyo time ndio mna discuss .
Discuss .
Na tukiongea kuhusu lugha do you have any role models ? Wenye ukiwaona hey .. hawa wameiva kilunga . Na do you even what to be like them in any way ama you are just contended the way ….
Am not contended , ok fine personally am doing journalism media and my role model when it comes to language maybe in english I love Beatrice Marshall . Yah I just love the way she talks and Sofi Ikenye yah those are my role models . Aah .. I know kuna wengine wanafanya better lakini so far hao nimeona wako poa kivyangu the way they speak . So yah am actually working hard kama hata ni possible niwapite .
Na what aspect do this people have that makes you admire them ?
Aah , ok Beatrice Marshall I love the way as in the way she talks the way she presents her work when she is talking , the way she articulate words I just love that yah . The way she talks that is what I love .
Ok , u 've watched some of the presenters , the TV presenters , ok do you think if you become soo formal in the TV sessions , like you know some examples in the TV , do you think it 's just ok or that thing is just plastic ?
Ok well , me I tend to think aah .. Unajua yani inadepend na presenters kuna presenters wengine wakiingia ok according to me vile me huona kama viewer and as an aspiring journalist kuna vile me huona kuna journalist wenye wanakuwa kaa yani composed natural as in they will talk the way they talk . They will make fun they will joke as in yani watakuwa very composed . Na kuna wengine yani ni plastic yani hiyo ndo unasema yani sikama uko real you just present , you are not yourself because maybe uko mbele ya camera you want to creat maybe an image that is not yours . But the reason why I love Beatrice Marshall to me I think yani yeye ukuwa natural vile mimi nimeona aki present yah so that is what I love .
Na formality na informality , do you think it 's important in the media maybe ?
Yah , it 's both important , formality kama tuseme when it comes to prime news , prime news unajua ni seriouse news most of the people are watching , some people do not take crap . So hiyo formality pia itasaidia to suite hawa watu na pia kuna hiyo show kama za morning unacheki as in kama hizo ni abit informal .
Watu hupenda humour .
Yah ( agree ) lakini sasa people are different unajua watu wazima yenyewe sirahisi hati wana pick pick crap people have their stuff to do so wanataka maybe wa watch news alafu kila mtu ajikate na shughuli yake unajua so yah , I think informality and formality ni very important yah .
Ok , given a chance maybe which , which aah .. Which one would you take ?
Ok me kama nikiwa presenter I would prefer ile informal yah , as in I tend to think when you are abit informal ni kama you are abit friendly , as in people can listen to you , you can communicate you can reach people because hauko ile ati very seriouse unajua ? so kama given a chance mimi ningechukua hiyo informal yah .
Sawa sawa now the informality might come through the mixing of languages the use of , ok this language maybe sheng that is , is known to be informal . What is your opinion about sheng , do you think it should be done away with or it 's something that we are suppose to leave ?
( laughter ) Unajua kama sheng , sheng kwanza most of the times ni mixture ya English na Kiswahili hiyo ndio na … na sasa siku hizi Kikuyu .. Aah .. ( laughter ) I think it 's something that we have to accept coz hatuwezi kusema ati tueliminate hiyo , unajua ni kama vile yani mtu anaongea unafika place kama nilikuwa naongea Kiswahili na lemewa naingilia ng 'oso . If i was speaking in English na lemewa naingilia Kiswahili sasa hiyo mixing mixing some words za English zimekuwa kama kwa Kiswahili za Kiswahili zimekuwa English hivo . So ok sheng by the way maticha walikuwa wana complain ati siku hizi wanafunzi wakiandika composition wanaandika sheng , yah that one is a disadvantage lakini at long run I tend to think bado iko na advantage . Ukitaka kureach watu when you want to reach to people as in you want to pass a certain message to people I tend to think hiyo mixing language hiyo usaidia sana as in inafanya hiyo situation ikuwe abit informal watu wanakuwa more comfortable so passing whatever information inakuwa rahisi . So in away as much as wanafunzi ndio labda wanadivert sana eeh .. lakini simbaya hivo inasaidia in away mmh ..
Now , from the way aah .. people from the different gender speak . Now do you think there is any difference in the way gender speak , especially in the kinds of words that they use ?
Ok well mimi according to me unajua kama sheng ile hard sheng maboys ndio upenda kutumia , ile hard sheng . Na English madem ndio wanapenda kutumia so there is actually diffrence according to me yah , most of the times unajua girls ni soft soft watatend to na by the way it happends mpaka in relationship or when you have your friend who is a guy you are talking to them in English and like they are responding in Swahali yah ama sheng it does happen .
What do you think it 's the reason that ladies are soft a little bit ?
Well , aah .. Unajua(laughter ) unajua sheng , sheng ujuhi at some point unajua kuna sheng ile ngumu kuna wasee huona hii kujua sheng ni prestingious bana as in sasa hiyo maboys wenye wanataka kukufeel wakujua wana flows materm hata wakitumua haugich as in haupati anything , so na girls yani eeh .. English as in ( pause ) English pia by the way ni fun alot of fun eeh .. ndio mana unapata wasee mob wana weng ni madem .
Ok , na ukipata dem wenye aah kingereza yake ni hivi hivi tu as in …
Ok fine it does happen sazingine pia depending on other factors , unajua yah .. Depending on other factors levels za English zina vary Kama yenyewe we do n't speak English sana unacheki so ni ile ya kucount ( laugher ) .
Na Ok , people love texting soo much nowadays , ok if from your experience and your opinion ni lugha gani watu hupenda kutext nayo sana ?
Sheng , a mixture of English and Swahili yah .
Na kuna situations watu wanaweza tumia pure English or pure Kiswahili kwa text ?
Kunazo lakini zinakuwa rare . Eehh yani maybe yani hizo text niulizemsee anakuandikia ng 'oso from page one to page four English yote so unabambika tu inacheka sasa sijuhi hata vile unareply bana I do n’t know yah lakini kunayo lakini ni rare na wakifanya hivo they use extremely hard words ile ya kuchange environment it 's more of humour sio hati hati wana realy communucate eeh .
Ok so that is the communication between you and your friends ?
yah .
Now watu wengine sasa ?
Watu wengine ina .. inadepend unajua .. Lakini sasa kuzoea kitu ndio mbaya as in unajipata ata kama ulikuwa unatext mtu serious pia umeingiza sheng coz umeshazoea as in the problem ni hiyo kuzoea . Lakini at some point kuna yenye uko alert unajua hee .. mind yako iko focused unabonga na lecturer hapa let me be a good student bana so unabonga na ng 'oso tu eeh .
Sasa ushaipata ushajipata kwa situation as in uko serous kabisa I want to chose this words for this specific text .
( laughter ) Ni hard bana eeh .. ni hard .
Ama inakuangatu unconsious ?
Eeh … ukitext , unajua ukitext ni kitu haufikiriangi saa hizo so most of the times yani na unajua ni ngumu pia yani kutext mtu formal kama lecturer ni ngumu bana . Unampigia simu unamalizana so texting according to mimi sana ni age-mates ma beshte hivo so na ukitext ni very informal ile mnachatt " niaje ? how was your day ? unaendeleaje " as in unaswitch by the way pia hapo kuna swtich " how was your day " hapo kuna pure English how was your day ? " ilikuwa poa , na yako ? " yah " I was asking kama " you can help me with that book " as in unacheki kuna switching ya language sana both English na Kiswahili . Unawezapata unause pure English unakata the next sentence itakuwa pure Kiswahili the next sentence unamix hivo .
It 's fun mixing languages ? Yah
Aah .. Very fun very interesting bana kamatu ungekuwa unaongea ongeatu very flat manze sinikama unaandika composition unacheki inabore .
inachukuwa situation ya class .
Yah ( agree ) ni boring bana .
Now so you talked of texting as an informal way of communicating so that you wo n't really feel comfortable to text your lecture . Now in situations when you even call them do you find yourself even mixing the language in the same call in the same convertation and maybe for what reasons ?
Mostly kama mumeingia for a long time .. You know kama tuseme you 've called briefly you can be formal for that short time lakini tuseme you are talking for a long time with anybody atakama environment ni formality you just find yourself switching languages mixing languages yah it just comes naturally as in you forget . Unajua the minute you are talking to a person for a long time hiyo environmnent inaenda ikiwa calm cool sasa unatend kukuwa abit formal .
So hii hukuja na mazoea ?
Yah ( agree ) hata pia ukiongea na mtu for along time unaweza kuwa unconfortable as in have been speaking English that whole time as in inacome naturally automatically tu unswitch yah .
Ok ama pia unatengemea vile hao wanaweza rusha maneno informal So you decide to go informal .
Yah ( agree ) ile direction watatake ndio utafuata yah .
Sawa sawa . Na ushawahi sikia ok , kuna watu huwa wanatumia coded language ok ile watu wanaelewa peke yao wanabuni lugha alafu wanatumia peke yao so that mtu mwingine hawezi elewa .
Mostly aah .. Mimi naweza kusema ni sheng as in sheng za different places zina differ zina vary wasee wa Eastlands wataongea different yani as in wasee wataongea different different sheng zina vary so watu wawili wa place moja wakiongea sheng yao inaweza kuwa unapitwa na maneno mengine yes ni sheng ingine unagich na ingine hata yanakupita tu mmh So I think hiyo inadepend na hiyo place umetoka unatumia sheng gani maneno gani because sheng si the same ati universal kama English at table haitachange unaona watu wataita ati sheng sijuhi waita meza yani yani ati as in watu wana different eeh .
So this one you come na places ?
Eeh na place penye umetoka .
Ok sawa sawa , nimeshukuru sana .
Sawa sawa thank you so much
