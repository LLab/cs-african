Igama ungubani ?
UNDESCERNIBLE
Asiqale-ke . What language or languages do you typically use with your family and why ?
Ah , most of the time kuba isiZulu coz we grew up eh- eh- like abantu abadala , abantu abasikhulisa bebekhuluma isiZulu so efemilini uma sihleli ndawonye we normally use isiZulu isikhathi esiningi , ebesekuthi lelidlanzana labantu abasha because ukushintsha kwezikhathi yabona , so basebenzisa isiZulu basimikse nesiNgisi . But uma ukhuluma nabantu abadala emndenini you need to use isiNgisi- isiZulu kakhulukazi . Ja . .
What language or languages do you use with friends and why ?
Ah , we usually use ah- English coz most of them- of them kuba eh- eh- like people who use different languages so for us to communicate when we ’re doing our stuff we have to use English coz basically that- that ’s the only way we can communicate coz that ’s the only language we can all understand so we have to use English at that time . But if- normally when I ’m around =
You mean your friends , abanye ba amaKhaladi , ba ama- abeSuthu =
Ja , so therefore we have to stick to English so we can understand each other . But lokho kuyahluka coz most of the times , isikhathi sempilo ngisipenda la eskoleni . But when I go home most of them =
La amanye amafriends ?
Ja . So different people , we have to divert to that sense of speaking English all the time so now you have to speak English everytime so now you have to switch back to speaking isiZulu .
What language or languages do you use in school ?
At the university ?
Ja at the university .
Ah , it ’s basically Zulu and English but most of Zulu . I can say 60% of English and 40% of Zulu .
Do you think it ’s important to know English and why ?
It is important to know English coz I think for me it ’s a basic language to communicate and- to understand stuff you have to know English , you have to understand English .
You mean to understand what you are doing at the university ?
Yes yes , because most of the things are interpreted in English , to understand that you have to understand English first . It ’s a basic language to- to- to be exposed to- to everything that has been done at university . So you cant- it ’s the first thing that you have to know .
Do you think it ’s important for anyone to know his or her native language ?
It is coz- basically uma- if you can loose isiZulu , you have lost the person you are . That ’s- that ’s the person- language okhulele kuyona and abantu abadala , abantu bakini bakhule bekhuluma leyo language , so umu- like- kufana nokuthi uluza amaroots . You ’re still there but amaroots are not there because =
Uchaza ukuthi you want to keep this basic identity and build all the other- reconstruct and build other identities on top of it-
On top of it . I do n’t have to loose it . Ichaza wena as umuntu owuMzulu because if isiZulu ungasasazi kodwa uwuMzulu (…) angisaboni ukuthi kuyayakha isense ukuba uMzulu . So it ’s important to =
Do you mix several languages in one conversation ? If yes , when and why ? And what languages do you tend to mix ?
Hhm … I normally mix isiZulu and English .
Which means your answer is yes ?
Yes . I normally mix isiZulu and English . The reason is isikhathi esiningi we tend to use English but at the back of our mind we grew up speaking isiZulu so isiZulu- even uma sesihleli sabangana like Zulus , let ’s say a group of five people , we are all Zulus . So we are going to speak isiZulu because we know we all understand isiZulu . But because our mental or umqondo wethu- indlela esesispende ngayo isikhathi sikhuluma isiNgisi we tend to- like uma ngingase ngenze iexample nje ngami . Indlela esesisikhulume ngayo isiZulu , I tend to forget amanye amagama in Zulu , not that angisawazi but it ’s just that the easiest way to explain something =
Uthi ukhuluma kufike kuqala elesiNgisi-
Ja , when you say that- but you are saying into ethize in English or in Zulu . Ubusticke kwisiZulu but because you have to think fast the only way you normally design- like- usujwayele the way you think fast you have to explain it in English .
Have you noticed any difference the way you speak and how other students talk ?
Ja , I ’ve noticed but- then lokho depends on our background like- where- like when did you start like Zu- English permanently or isikhathi esiningi osuspende ukhuluma isiNgisi sona sesibe singakanani . Like for example , for me , isikhathi la ngiqale khona ukukhuluma isiNgisi , spending more hours speaking English is when I finished my matric and came in here at varsity , so that ’s when I started speaking English . So English- indlela engikhuluma ngayo isiNgisi is different to another person . So it ’s easy to identify a person osiqale esephuma kwamatric ukukhuluma isiNgisi nomuntu oqale like at an early age .
Can you tell if someone is from your area by the way he or she talks ? How can you tell ?
Ja , I can tell . I can tell because- like- there is this kind of- ngingathini ? Kuzoba iaccent . There is this model accent . Umunntu- umuntu wangasekhaya- like osuka ngasekhaya . Even- mhlawumbe ngoba bazohluka but abangasekhaya abafunde kulezizikole eziphucuzekile , abanye bazofunda kulezizikole nje =
What do you mean eziphucuzekile ? Multi-racial ?
Ja , multi-racial =
Model C ?
Yes , yes , multiracial . So that person uzokhuluma isiNgisi in a different way even though ephuma kwiarea yami but a person ofunde esikoleni sami , even though singomakhelwane , esuka la eza la but lo uzofunda ku-multi-racial lo uzofunda ekhaya so even lo wangasekhaya ekhuluma isiNgisi , ngikhule naye , I ’ll understand him , ngizomuzwa ukuthi oh lo owangase khaya . Lo owaku-multi-racial ngizomuzwa ukuthi oh ukhule efunda ufestiye was doing this and- ja .
Okay . If you just heard someone talk without seeing this person , would you tell what kind of background he or she has ? That is , their level of education , position in society , political affiliation , etc ?
Ja , you can- you can- I think you can identify , you can tell . Because , like- it tends to be a trend yokuthi , people like abakwipolitiki , let me say the accent they use or they speak ngalendlela le or they use amagama in English . Lama- like- they use =
Choice of words , vocabulary ?
Yes , yes , yes . And then ebese kuthi , ebese kuthi laba abafunde kuma multi-racial uzozwa ukuthi like indlela abakhuluma ngayo , indlela like- like ah for example like- amagama aba- like “ oh my God ” and ah- labantu laba uyayizwa igroup yabo ukuthi oh , ilegroup le . Besekuthi wena okhuluma isiNgisi ngoba ufuna ukudlulisa umyalezo uyezwa ukuthi this person is speaking English to transfer to- to- to- ukuhhambisa umyalezo kuphela . Hhayi ukuthi there is that addition . So you can tell from a person okhuluma isiNgisi ngoba- okwipolitiki- owusomapolitiki , ngizosho njalo . Besekuba ilona ofunde kuma-multi-racial noma okhulele endaweni vele la kukhulunywa khona isiNgisi from early age . Ebese kubakhona lo okhuluma isiNgisi ngoba efuna ukudlulisa umyalezo .
Do you speak different languages to different people ? Where and why ?
Hhhmmm … I do speak different languages , it ’s English and Zulu . And- and I think most of the time I speak different languages when- to different people .
And when ?
When we are doing group works , senza igroup work we are mixed up , mhlawumbe we have Zulus , we have Xhosas and we have =
Where do you do that group work ?
At school .
At the university ?
Ja , at the university , we have white people =
And why do you speak differently to different people ?
Oh , I ’ll explain that . Like for us , mina nje for me , sometimes it ’s very easy to ukuthi umuntu ngimchazele- uma- mhlawumbe ngimchazele isibalo noma ini , ngingakwazi ukuthi ngimchazele ngesiZulu ngithi “ ndoda , yabona la u-x ushona la kanje kanje , thatha leyanto uyibeke la ” but uma sengichazela umuntu owumlungu , I cant use English noma sengibona ukuthi akaandastendi isiZulu , ngithi ndoda “ nakhu nakhu nakhu , nakhu ndoda ” . Uma =
Mhlawumbe uzama ukumchazela ngesiNgisi uthole ukuthi akaandastendi ugcine ususwishe to =
Switch to a language azoyi understander kangcono .
Have you ever tried to change anything about the way you talk , and why ? Have you ever tried ?
Ja , I have n’t- ah no , I did to qualify that phela you have to be in a same standard . La eyunivesithi you have to know English to get through . So I can say ukuthi- not that mhlawumbe I ’ve noticed =
The way you talk , not the way you use =
The way you talk ?
Ja , do you change anything- have you ever tried to change anything about the way you talk ?
Like the accent , kwasha kwacima ?
Like the accent , the way you pronounce like Americans , instead of saying water you say waarter ?
Ja , ja , it happens .
So why ?
I do n’t know . Lapho I have to be honest , ukuthi mhlawumbe- mhlawumbe =
You just aping ? Uba inkawu sort of . [ BOTH LAUGHING ]
Ja , you feel ukuthi akengiyishaye kanje lento , naleli uthi “ akengilishaye kanje . ” Liyachaza uma ngilishaya kanje , liyachaza uma ulishaya kanje . But kwesinye isikhathi =
You want to pronounce words the way they are pronounced by native speakers of English ? English words .
Mmhhh .
What are the issues that you and your friends talk about these days and why ?
I mean =
What are the issues ?
Mina to be honest , like we had a huge debate nabangani bami recently siphuma kofunda . We- we- we debate that ukuthi like we were debating ngalento yecolonialism ukuthi what happened coz we have different views about that . Like ah- kade sisuka elibrary siya eRes coz mina- mina I have a different view about that and nabo have a different view and it turns out I ’m the only person who agrees in a different thing and nabo bavumelana ngento eseceleni . So we- we normally talk about girls uma samaJita sihlangene . Not most of the time but isikhathi esiningi we talk about ipolitiki and we like politics stuff . Ja .
And why do you talk about girls ?
Ah , I think it ’s part of growing up . I can say that , it ’s part of growing up as a boy , changing stages and seeing girls you like , you tell your friends “ I like that one ” and it ’s like , part of growing up but we do n’t like normally waste our energy on that section . We just talk about that that “ oh , that one is fine ” but we do n’t dwell =
You are saying that is your future , you cannot avoid talking about girls ?
Yes .
Because one day it will- you want to get married =
You can n't run away from =
Is there any other issue that you want to talk about that interest you ?
Mhlawumbe ngaphansi kwani ?
Whatever issue , natural- that comes naturally that you think- that you feel you want to talk about .
I do n’t know if- maybe I can- I can pose this question to you Sir . Mina mhlawumbe ngalento esesike sabanayo ngedebate about in few days back , I do n’t know if mhlawumbe I can ask wena .
Ja .
Mina what I believe in ukuthi as- as black people we still have like- there is that- kusanaleya mentality kubantu abamnyama ukuthi , ngingathini ? Kuna- kunale-design like at first ngalenkathi kufika icolonialism- kufika abantu abamhlophe la eAfrica . Kunedesign abafika nayo and njengoba izikhathi zishintsha i-design iyashintsha in a way .
What do you mean by design ?
Like- like I believe ngoba ngithe uma ngibuka ngabona ukuthi- ngathi mina asikhohlwe ithina laba balana evarsity . Think about South Africa as a whole , wena mhlawumpe uwu zero point zero one percent wabantu balana eSouth Africa . Think about a person owaphuma eskoleni , wa- wa- waphuma ngoba ngenza iexample- sasikhuluma ngokukhulelwa kwezingane , babethi amaJita , izingane zine choice yokuthi zikhulelwe . Mina ngithi think about a person okhule kwienvironment uMama wakhe akasebenzi , uBaba wakhe akasebenzi , ubhuti wakhe naye uhleli ekhaya . Uyafunda , let ’s just say ufunda u-eight , umngani mhlawumbe anaye , isikhathi asispendayo akasafundi naye , mhlawumbe sewasiyeka isikole . Ngicela ungicabangele lomuntu ukuthi mhlawumbe ujola nalomJita lona owusiCabha , uzomnika imali , uzomkhuleliswa athole imali yegrant . Umucabango lomuntu iyiphi- eyiphi enye into anayo ekhanda ngaphandle kwalento emsurroundile ? Coz I think for you to think differently , kumele ube- kumele uspende noma kumele ube kwindawo la ezokwenza ukuthi ucabange ngalendlela ozoba iyona kusasa . Coz I think to be something tomorrow kumele uqale manje =
Uchaza ukuthi lomuntu all she is thinking about ukuthi uScabhaboy has money =
Has money =
Is not thinking about ifuture ukuthi =
Iskole it does n’t mean anything . Ngasengathi mina-ke , think about a person =
Okusho ukuthi yena akacabangi ngokuba independent , ukuthi one day- because nayo into efuneka ukuthi we all want to be independent .
Yes . Yes . And then ngasengathi “ step back , asibuyele emuva kancane ” , uMawakhe naye let ’s say mhlawumpe , similar thing yenzeke kuyena , kusuka lapho =
Uthini lapho ? Icolonialsation esishintshile imindset ?
Yes .
It looks like icolonisation ishintshe imdinset , yathi asingacabangi the way we used to think because kumina lomuntu okhulelwise uScabhaboy ebese efuna ukuthi nje impilo irounde- revolve around uScabhaboy . It shows lack of education neexposure ukuthi lomuntu uvaleke la , is wearing amablinkers . Lamablinkers la amvalile akakwazi ukubuka ngapha ukuthi , nokuthi azihlelele ifuture and so in future- in the past bekuhlalwa kanjalo umuntu avele acabange ukuthi all I need to is to grow up , ngiqome and get married , and so if that does not happen , akasho- ayikho iquestion . I was interviewing somebody yesterday engiqale ngaye ukuthi all they are thinking about is when are they going to get married . Whilst ubusy obsessing with getting married , you should be thinking ngokuthi , let ’s say awunayo ingane , at such a stage kufuneka ngabe senginayo ingane kodwa leyongane kufuneka uyazi ukuthi izodinga isupport . You should have thought about first ukuthi my level of education , am I going to be able to support this child ? Nginga- ungakabi nayo . So you plan ukuthi I need to have kids one day , and therefore I must get educated , start working . Lengane must have a home and therefore I must start thinking about that . Uma iya eskoleni I must have a car . Kwesinye iskhathi omunye umuntu gets discouraged ukuthi- okade ecabanga ukuthi uzokushada- uzoshada nawe , akubuke ukuthi your level of thinking , you ’re finished . Wena ufuna ukudepender all your life . It ’s a turn off . Whereas wena if you upgraded yourself , ngabe isishintshile lento . I remember saying to one woman , after fourteen years ngithandana naye . Okay , ngiyakushiya manje kodwa I ’m leaving you , you ’re a better person because wake waphuma eskoleni earlier on . Wanede wangibona ngiadvancer , weza wangilandela wafunda . Today uma ngikushiya , you ’ll get married because bonke abantu bakubuka unefuture ekahle and therefore- you did not waste your time ngoba ngaku- wathi yazi “ wangi encourager , I remember ukuthi ustandard nine ngasengiwuyekile , ngithi angisafundi . When I saw you starting to go to university , uqhubeka , and and then I started following . ” And ngithi namhlanje unediploma , you ’re a teacher because you followed and therefore you ’ll get a husband . It ’s just that you are not the type of a girl I ’m looking forward to marrying . And so , forget . Do n’t hate me because ngikwenze wangcono .
Ja .
Okay baba .
