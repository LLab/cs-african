Thank you for coming for this discussion , on the languages . Aa , the way you use language in everyday life . On campus , or at home . So I have a few questions that we will discuss , and you can free to use any language-yea-any language that you wish to use .
Okay
Yea , so I want to : -to start by asking you what language do you typically use with your family ?
Mm , in my family : it depends with the people I am talking to . If I 'm talking to : my mom and dad I at times use vernacular .
Vernacular ?
Yea . But when I 'm talking amongst my brothers and sisters we at times talk Sheng . And uuh , at times we : even talk vernacular . For instance my brother can talk in-tell me " I 've missed talking Dholuo " , we talk =
So you talk Dholuo .
Dholuo . Yea .
Yea , okay . And when you say Sheng ? What-what languages would those be that you are mixing ?
Now in Sheng consists of aa : -I mean basically there are like three languages . Mm , for instance there is English in Sheng , there is Swahili in Sheng , there is also some bit of uuh , Kikuyu , in Sheng . Yea . For instance the Kikuyu word uuh-I mean the Sheng word shosho , it comes from a Kikuyu word uuh they called the " shosho " it 's written " c-u-c-u " . Yea .
Mm . What I mean is-like you said with your brothers , and sisters , you use Sheng .
Yea , Sheng .
Yea . So : .. -which means-which means that you 'll be mixing some languages , uh ?
Yea .
Would you also be mixing for example Kiswahili , English and Dholuo ?
Mm , probably . Probably some bits of it . Yea , we do =
So with them you also mix some Dholuo but =
Some Dholuo .
Yea . But typically parents it 's Dholuo ?
It 's Dholuo , and at times my dad can call . And then he starts a conversation " Unaendeleaje shuleni ? " so when he starts like that , we : talk like in : Swahili but not that fluent Swahili .
Mm hh .
Yea .
( chuckles , smile on his face ) When you say " not that fluent Swahili " what type of Swahili [ uncertain transcription] =
You know fluent Swahili it 's like you : unazingatia kanuni za lugha , sarufi . Atakuuliza hali ya shule iko vipi , unamwambia " we are doing good in school " . Halafu at times I find myself even talking Sheng , at that time .
Even-even with your dad ?!
Now , for instance he asks me " unaendeleaje how is school ? " Unaendeleaje how is school .
Ooh , okay . So he 's also mixing .
He 's also mixing .
Yea , yea , yea .
So you find that we do n't-it 's not that consistent =
It 's not very strict .
Yea .
Okay . How about with your friends ?
Now with my friends ,
At home .
At home , it depends . There are friends at times we do talk purely Dholuo .
Purely Dholuo .
Dholuo .
Which is-eh he-so when you say it depends , there are friends you speak Dholuo to . And others ?
And then there are others , when your friend starts a conversation in maybe Sheng , you 'll not talk Dholuo to him . You 'll also talk in Sheng . So when-when one starts a conversation in Dholuo , you 'll also-
Mm hh .
Talk Dholuo . So that 's why I was saying it depends with , yea .
Ooh , okay . What if you are the one starting the conversation ?
If I 'm the one =
Typically , which one do you start with your friends ?
With my friends .
Which language would you start-start off with , at home .
At home , it will again depend on what you 're talking about .
Mm mh . Give me an example na :
An example , for instance maybe we are talking about uh , maybe a chic . Maybe they will see a chic , because where I come from , my setting , we neighbor the Abagusi .
Abagusi .
Yea . So maybe you want to talk about a Sheng-uh , I mean uuh a chick who is maybe around , and you do n’t want her to like , uuh =
She 's Kisi .
You do n't want her to get what you 're saying .
Yea .
So you might say " Eh ! how do you see her ? unamuonaje ? " Utasema
How do you say it in your =
In my mother tongue utasema you will say inene nade ? Inene is like is like kuona =
Unamuonaje ?
Unamuonaje ?
Eh hee !
So in that particular time , we want to hide that from her . And then we use =
And what if she 's not within =
If she 's not within =
Earshot , like she can n't hear anyway ?
If she can n't hear , we 'll just talk in ? Sheng . Because conversations , especially in my vernacular , even when maybe you want to like go for a chick unataka kumchinjia , it will be very awkward talking to her : umm , I mean you there and you are in vernacular . It would sound so boring .
So boring . Mm hhm .
Yea , so definitely you will talk Sheng . And even here now that I am a Swahili student , I 'll not even use the pure Swahili fluent one . Cuz at times =
But you know that fluent Swahili ?
I know it very well . But I 'll not because at that particular time that lady will see you like-it 's boring =
It 's boring .
Yea , unazungumza , wewe umeshindwa unazungumza Kiswahili sanifu atashangaa huyu jamaa , in as much as you know it , but in that particular context , you feel like =
So , what you mean is , this friend will be : not a Swahili student like you , who does n't speak that Swahili . But what if this student is from the coast for example ?
If he 's from the coast , like now , in school . Here . When we now come back to school , the setting , campus , now when we =
Tell me about friends in school , how do you use language ?
Friends in school , uuh , especially the coursemates , we talk fluent , Kiswahili sanifu maanake tunataka tuwe na uzoefu wa kuzungumza Kiswahili . But if now friends maybe : who are not coursemates , we 'll always-we at times do talk Sheng . In as much as English-at times we do talk English but { mostly it 's Sheng } . Yea .
{ mostly it 's Sheng } . Aah okay . And eh : , how about English ? Do you think English is an important language for anyone to know ?
English I think uh :
Is it important for you to know English ?
Definitely ? Because right now in the setting-uuh-an English is spoken wide-uh-widely , spoken widely . And uuh , for any person , uuh-for instance you might get an opportunity to travel to the UK . So you can imagine that scenario you 're there and you-like you do n't even speak any of the broken one or maybe you speak-because English there are people who speak English but it now depends on levels . There are those who just speak English for the purpose aah aonekane kwamba anazungumza kingereza lakini kuna wale ambao watazungumza mwenyewe unaona huyu jamaa ana umilisi
Mm mmh
Yea . So I think =
Anafahamu .
Anafahamu . So : I think it 's very important to-to learn English . And uh , =
But when you say that-you said that if you want to travel to the UK , you need the English .
Yea-yea-I mean =
How about when want to-you travel to Spain , you get a chance to go to Spain , why not learn-why do n't you want to know Spanish , for example ? ( smiling )
No . Right now I think we 've been cultured . We 've given a lot of prominence , in our-in our own setting the way we 've been brought up , we 've been given a lot of-we 've given a lot of prominence to English as compared to these other languages . And average you 'll find that in Kenya if you were to : maybe carry out a research . You 'll find that uh , the majority-uuh , the majority of the Kenyan population speak English as compared to Swahili . Most people shy away from speaking in Swahili . Which is again =
What do you think are the reasons for that ?
Now the reasons for that =
Do you think it 's a good thing ?
It 's not a-it 's not a good thing because uh-for anybody who is supposed to be : multi-lingual or tri-lingual if there is a word like that ,
Yea . Mm mhh . There is , because if you speak two languages , you 're-you 're-you 're bi-lingual .
Bilingual .
If you speak three trilingual .
Trilingual , yea .
But multi-lingual is now more than three .
Ok . So for you uh-I mean uuh , the Swahili , the reason why people like shy away . Especially for now-in my-let me take from perspective-my : context , the Luo context . One , the Luo people associate Swahili with the people who come from the coast .
Mm mh .
And people who come from the coast wanaonekana ni watu wajanja . Watu ambao labda minendo yao sio mizuri . Sasa ukienda kule uanze kuzungumza Kiswahili sanifu , uuh , wale : waliozeeka katika jamaa wataona huyu jamaa ulienda Mombasa ukajifunza na . They 'll associate you with-like you : =
Some form of =
Form of you : , like you go away to the coast and you 've been umeanza kuwa kama wale Waswahili . And apart from that , when you now start speaking Swahili in my community , watahusisha na Uislamu . And in my community majori-i : in as much as siku hizi kuna watu ambao siku hizi wamekuwa Waislamu , lakini watu wengi si Waislamu . Kwa hivyo wataona kwamba mtu yoyote tu , ( uncertain transcription ) mtu yoyote anayezungumza Kiswahili anaonekana kwamba ni =
{ Muislamu }
{ Muislamu } . Apart from that , another reason people shy away from speaking in-in : Kiswahili , because uh , uh , when uuh : it dates back to:-it 's something that has been there since time immemorial . It dates back to : when uuh : -when the-the-when the colonies came to Kenya . Uuh =
You mean the British .
The British . Uuh , they were-you know there were two competing religions . Islamic and Christianity .
And Christianity .
So when they saw that " when we make these people speak in Kiswahili , we are promoting Islamic . Because most of words , in Kiswahili are borrowed from maneno mengi , yamekopwa kutoka kwa : Kiarabu . Kwa hivyo waliona kwamba tuki imiza hawa [ uncertain transcription ] =
Aaah , so that negative attitude eh ?
It has been there =
Eh hee ! I never thought of that , yea , it 's true .
That is how people have -it has been there , and we like in generations we are really transmitting it to other generations .
Mm mmh
Yea .
Okay , that 's a very good explanation . Eeeh , how about-how about native language ?
My native =
Like your Dholuo , do you think it 's important to know a native lang-for anyone to know a native language ?
Definitely , I think it 's very important .
Mm mmh . How-how is that important ? Why do you think it 's important ?
Well for one , it 's because of uuh : -you know you need to interact and for you to interact you need to be multi-dimensional . Anybody for you to grow in a society you need to be multi-dimensional .
Yea .
In a sense that , in as much as you might learn and get your maybe you get your undergraduate , you go to masters , get a PhD . There 's a time you 'll have to come into contact with your people .
Mm mmh .
And you can imagine a scenario you 'll go maybe attend-to attend a funeral or it 's a gathering that has maybe different people from all walks of life . There are those people who do n't know Kiswahili , those old people at home . So you can imagine you are speaking to them in English , and they are people who never saw the classrooms . So it 's very important for you to know . Apart from that , each person should be able to trace his origin and know the culture , where you come from . And there 's no way I 'm going to know Dholuo , if I do n't know have-the culture of the Luo , if I do n't know Dholuo-the language itself .
But there are people who are born in Nairobi ,
Yea .
Their parents are even born in Nairobi ,
In Nairobi
There are even grandparents probably born in Nairobi and then their parents , then themselves , in Nairobi . Do n't you think those people-and they do n't speak their-their { native languages }
{ native languages }
Yea , they are there . Have you encountered such people ?
Yea I have .
So , do you think they do n’t have an origin ?
They definitely have . They have .
Because you said language , you need to know it because of =
Now that is to-it is that identity to aah-I mean to some co-to some-some-I mean aah , to some context . But rather , its very important because right now , in as much as uh-if you look at the system , the government system right now , there 's that devolution .
Mm mhh .
So devolution means you can be taken-you might land in a job in maybe your home county , so in your home co =
A rural setting .
A rural setting .
So for you , it seems like the native language is important in that rural setting .
Yea .
But when you go to Nairobi or come to Moi University , it 's not that-there 's no importance really .
It 's-it 's=
Is that what you mean ?
No , I ’m not ruling out that . It 's equally important . Because , for one there was a time you need like-you should-you should maybe belong somewhere . For instance you might want something to-to share , with people or maybe people who come from your home [ uncertain transcription ] . So at that particular point you share . Because it-for in-for instance in the universities there are those tribal associations-I do n't know-they are there . You find maybe there 's 90 county student associations I do n't know it 's a form of =
Do you think it 's a good thing ? To have these rural =
I do n't think uuh : -in as much as it 's supposed to be there , but I do n’t think it 's a good idea . Because for one , when you-when people meet there , they speak purely . I 've att-I once attended mine . Yea , it 's called [ uncertain transcription , sounds like Radutha Rachura District ]
Yea .
So I once attended . People speak purely =
Dholuo .
Dholuo .
Mm mh .
And this-during maybe elections , at the universities , you find now people like aligning themselves to the tribe [ uncertain transcription ]
Tribal . So : it 's not good really =
It 's not good .
Because if it was about culture and discussing how-what is common about you , that would have been something .
It would have been uuh =
But now it 's-it 's turned into politics of the day =
Politics , tribal blogs ,
And this happens even in Nairobi , University . I see that in newspapers . That students are aligning themselves in terms of community .
No : it 's not-{not a good thing } .
{ Which is not a good thing } .
I 've even seen , some people-when people go-aah-maybe booking rooms . Somebody goes to : -this way " I want to stay with maybe somebody who comes from = "
From the same =
From the same place . My tribe .
And you expect campus to be multi : ethnic =
You interact .
You interact . You want to know people from Garisa , people from coast . You want to mingle .
Yea . Like me , since I started in my joint first year I 've never stayed with somebody who comes from the same tribe .
Aah , okay . So you want somebody =
I 've never wanted to . Because definitely , there 's nothing you 're going to learn new .
There 's nothing new you 're going to learn .
And your language will als o-o nly be-you will find yourself even if you do n't want to , at times you will find yourself talking your vernacular . And right now-and maybe somebody comes , you 'll even-you might exclude a third person . Somebody comes in , and you can find yourself talking vernacular , you 're excluding this third per-third party here .
Yea , because campus is people from different communities .
Yea .
I think in equal numbers , you 'll find people from all over the country .
Yea .
Ok . Yea , do you tend to-to mix , languages in a conversation ?
Yea .
Do you , do that ?
I do that .
Which languages would these be ?
Mmm , in a conversation =
Mm , I mean in just one conversation , not o o-o ver a day : or several days . Just like one conversation you are having , do you mix languages ?
At times I do mix languages .
Which ones mostly ?
Mostly :
Mm mmh .
It 's Kiswahili and English mostly .
When-when would this be ? When-where-when you are : doing what ?
Maybe interacting for instance you are watching a football match at the student center , you are watching a game . So you know : , you 're like there and you 're talking =
What expressions would you like say : for example commenting about the match ?
The match like " Huyu jamaa ametoa shoti poa " so =
Ametoa shoti poa .
So like that you know it 's like if you were to say " Eh huyu jamaa eh mcharazo wake ni mzuri " , people would like-(they both laugh ) .
Yea , you 'd-you 'd feel just awkward and out of place .
And uh , another instance that I find myself mixing , maybe I approach a-I have interest in a lady . And then I approach her . So you know you 'll feel like- you want to:-you 're there you 're vibing and you 're all in Kiswahili " Habari yako ? Nini " so it 's like-it 's not-it 's boring . It does n't fit that context .
Yea . Mm mhh .
And another time I find myself mixing in a conversation-I find myself mixing Dholuo , and uuh , English . Maybe I have a friend whom we come from home . So as we talk , you know at times you-there 's times you want to talk in a conversation and you want to look for a word . So : you 're looking for a word and it 's like not coming and you see this is a Luo we are talking to , you go for the word that is easily available because you 've grown in that Luo and a lot of uuh , vocabulary you-you have them ready .
You have them ready .
So when you want to talk and you are like looking for a word , and it 's not coming , and you see there 's a Luo so you go for the Luo word and you put it in the conversation .
So : what you 're telling me is , during a football match , English , Kiswahili .
English , Kiswahili .
But interestingly when you are-when it is Luo , it 's English . Why English and not Luo and Kiswahili ?
I think , it 's there . It depe-and most of my friends , here , they are people they say that uh " Kiswahili , hata wewe : mbona unasomea Kiswahili ? " They shy away from Kiswahili . So that 's why English comes in .
There is something that Luos have against Kiswahili that , I do n’t know .
I-it 's the same thing that uuh- that 's why when-for instance me when I get back at home people ask you " what are you studying at the university ? "
You tell them Kiswahili .
" Kiswahili . Eh ! Utawezana nayo " ( they both laugh )
They can n't believe . ( laughing )
Yea . Wewe utawezana nayo kweli ? Nawaambia " mimi nafikiri Kingereza ninachofahamu kimenitosha " .
Kimenitosha .
" Sasa sasa hivi , nataka nijifunze { Kiswahili } "
{ Kiswahili } kwa kindani
Eeh .
So most of the people there would be : shying away from Kiswahili . Mostly preferring English .
English .
And uh , why do you mix these languages , maybe you have said it but just-just tell me again like why ? Why ?
Now , first I think it 's to fit a context . Because for one , let me just tell you the example I gave you . Maybe I ’m interested in a lady , and I want to approach her . So when I approach her , it 's like-when I use ah =
But not all ladies speak Sheng . Not all of them . But are you just attracted to those ones that =( interrupted by laughter )
Aah no .
Because you would find one who is probably so : conservative .
Yea . Mm . But =
She 's very conservative . You try to use Sheng , she-she-
English . Yea but mostly-the ones I-I do n’t know . Mostly-most ladies use Sheng .
Or they are attracted . Or even these conservative ones they might even be attracted to that guy who can speak Sheng .
Speak Sheng uh ?
Mmm !
And you know Sheng there are categories of the lighter Sheng and there are some Sheng which like he ! Somebody talks and you 're like , you floating and you do n't [ uncertain transcription]-
So which one do you speak yourself ?
My Sheng is just the normal one . Not the Sheng that undani kabisaaa
Mm . And are there students who speak that one that you-
Definitely there are people who maybe they have grown-because if somebody speaks Sheng , you are able to tell ' this grew up in a particular setting . This one has grown up-{eeh entire of his life in Nairobi } . "
{ So those ones are the strong Sheng . }
The strong Sheng . Utaona huyu =
From where ?
Utaona huyu , ni kama ameleleka amezaliwa Nairobi : akaleleka huko ama kama ni maybe Kisumu : akazaliwa huko akaleleka huko .
Mm mmh .
Again there 's a Sheng maybe you : utaona aah huyo anavyozungumza Sheng , sio mtu ameleleka mjini . Huyu labda alikuwa tu kule mjini-ah ! Kijijini . Amekuwa kule lakini sasa ndio anajifunza kuzungumza =
Anajifunza Sheng pole pole . Eeh ? Okay .
So you 're able to tell the difference .
Mm mmh .
Yea .
Okay . So : when it 's an issue of approaching a lady Sheng is =
Sheng is preferred .
An advantage . ( they both laugh )
Yea . ( laughing conspiritorially )
That 's interesting . Okay , these ladies , I thought some of them just prefer English . They are those ones that just speak English almost throughout .
You 're able to tell . No . You 're able to tell . There are ladies you see , you 'll tell =
So you would not approach those ones ?
You know :
Cuz they are there =
You 'll now change your tactics .
Ooh , okay . ( they both laugh heartily ) . It 's about tactics heh ?
Yea , you do n't change =
So you have to be clever . You know your target =
You say " hi " . There are those who say " hi " , poa . So you know you 're like eh !
Ok . You try to say " sasa " they say " hi " ?
Hi .
So what do you do ?
See yea , those ones you 're purely English .
So you mean you 're flexible . You can =
With me I think I 'm flexible , I can adjust .
You can move very quickly to the ' hi ' .
And now I have an advantage because if it 's Swahili , she starts Swahili , I think I 'll also be okay . If it 's English , I 'll again be okay .
And your Sheng also is there ?
Yea .
Oh okay . Is there a difference you feel when like-or you notice between the way you talk and the way other students talk ?
At times I do notice .
Eh he ? What kind of differences ?
Differences is , uh-for instance my accent .
Mm mh .
I 'm not saying that I 'm that good but uuh , when maybe a Luo speaks , you know the Luo , Dholuo , I 'm a Luo , the way the Luo speaks is just known . If it 's commission anasema " komison " ( laughter ) , so they are those they are here . They are those who speak that . You are able to : =
And people from other regions ?
People from other regions =
Do you also have those things ?
Definitely . When a Luya speaks you are able to tell he 's a Luya . When a Kalenjin speaks you 're able to tell . A Kamba speaks , you 're able to tell .
And the way you tell you 're saying is because of accent .
The accent . The pronounciation =
Or-or the mother tongue interfering actually , is it ?
Um , I think the mother tongue interferance counts . Again if you look at all the aspects of grammer like the phonetics how they-or maybe how the phonological-how they pronounce words , it 's again , it will vary . It will tell you =
Is it still because of the mother tongue ?
The mother tongue has got a lot of influence . Because for one-people tend to-if that person has grown up in : the rural setting , spend a lot of his life there or her life there , that person , whenever he or she wants to speak , she 'll start from the vernacular and then translate . That person will first of all think in the vernacular and then translate to English which will affect the way she or he communicates .
But we have this group that you said that were born in town . Their Kiswahili is okay , their English is very good .
Mm , no . Not everybody who is born in : town has that-has that =
We are assuming these affluent .
Oh okay . The affluent ?
Those ones who comes from uuh , maybe Kileleshwa :
Kileleshwa : , Karen
Yea , those places . Can you tell this person ?
Yea , you 're able to tell , using the English . But Swahili I have n't-these people coming from this-uuh-maybe : like Kileleshwa : , Guruburu , these people they do n't-Kiswahili , no .
No .
It 's definitely English . They use English a lot . Yea .
So that you would definitely see a-differences ?
You will see a difference .
In the way you talk , in the way other students talk .
Yea and you 'll-you 're able to tell to some extent that this one went to : a private school ( they both laugh heartily ) ,
And this one :
This one went to a public-of course there are public schools which are =
Also good .
Equally good . But the rural public school where you do n't expect like much-they do n't dwell so much on-the English students speak because the teachers there themselves , the language they speak , itself , there 's no way they are going to like tell these students to speak fluently .
So from these differences , can you tell from where a person comes from ?
Yea .
From the way they talk ?
Yea , you are able to tell .
The area they come from , you 're able to tell ?
I think you 're able to tell .
You have made it clear that accent will definitely help you place people .
Yea .
Over the map of Kenya .
Over the map of Kenya .
To say this one is here , this one is here ?
Yea , that you are able to trace the linguistical landscape of Kenya because if aah , maybe somebody from-ah-though there has-there are instances when you 're not able . You might try categorizing and you 'll see like =
Mm . Oh , so it 's not always 100% .
It 's not always .
It 's not always .
There are people they are not able to tell where they come from =
But you can =
You can try tracing =
You can try to-to approximate .
Yea , to approximate .
The most likely . But are there people who you are blank completely , you are like " Ay ! I try to listen , listen they are talking , they are talking then you 're like ay ! I do n’t know "
No , I do n’t know , because =
They are there ?
There are people-now-what will now come to your mind you will now start looking at their appearance and placing-if you can n't . Because there are times somebody wants to identify " huyu msichana " una you ask yourself " huyu msichana atakuwa anatoka kabila gani ? anavyozungumza ? " Mwenzako anakwambia " eh siwezi " . Sasa unaangalia -you start-go for the appearance .
Mm mmh . Appearance =
With this brown skin and-this looks like ( mutual laughter)she comes from central .
This is not Dholuo . This is not a Dholuo chick .
This is not a Jaluo chick .
Ok . So appearance also helps ?
Yea , you can =
You can use appearance =
You can use appearance to gage .
How about other language features ? Not necessarily because of your mother tongue influence , other language features like choice of words , topics ? These people from these area like certain topics . Is it possible to do that ?
I think it 's-it 's-it 's possible to tell , and it 's believed that uh-for instance , right now , in Kenya : if you look at the : -you-politics . For instance if people talk politics you are able to tell this is a : Luo talking . If-if-if the langauge is not able to help you identify him or her . For instance right now you 'll see somebody-maybe there 's an appointment in the ministry and then somebody saying " Ah , I do n't like the way : the president appointed so and so " . You 'll definitely say this person is against the president and he might be affiliated to the Luo .
Luo .
You might tend to say that . Or maybe the prime minister-the former prime minister did something . And you 're like for instance the : -the recent saga about the airport issues , the way he was like-so if somebody =
He denied access to =
Access to the third lounge .
The VIP lounge .
The VIP lounge . So you know sometimes =
When people discuss that you will =
When people discuss that you will see somebody aligning to-aligning to the side of Kimwemwe :
That 's interesting . So you can tell things like political affiliation ?
You can tell =
Just based on the way somebody is talking ?
And the political affiliation will now help you to place that person into the linguistic where he comes from . These are Luo-Yea .
How about level of education for example of somebody ? Based on the way they-they talk , when you just listen to them talk . Can you say this person is-this guy- ya primary school hakupita ?
Yea . You are able to tell .
And this one , this one went to USIU ,
You are able to tell . But there are instances when , you might try and you cannot tell- because for instance , the choice of words , for maybe-and depending on the conversation . If for instance maybe somebody with a professor is back there at home maybe addressing a group of people , he 'll only speak that language according t o-o r he 's addressing a professor comes home-and then he 's addressing maybe a room consisting of Class 8 kids , you 'll-you know he 'll restrict himself .
So it 's possible-what you 're saying is that it 's possible for a professor to go down to the level of-of village people when =
To switch =
When addressing those people =
Yea , to suit them . But when he 's addressing students in class , the language changes .
But do you think that professor would go down to the level of a village chief ?
Ay ! No , no , no , no ( they both laugh heartily )
Cuz if you 're Class 8 , this guy will go-can you tell the difference , like for a village chief and a professor when they both-from when they are talking ?
You are able to tell . Because their choices of words-he might find himself-because mostly =
Because in that instance , the professor will be making an effort to do what ?
An effort in restraining . So if =
But this village elder ?
Definitely with him now you 'll feel like he is talking-he is very okay with it . He 's not like struggling to go for the words .
So you can tell that this guy is a village elder and this one .. he 's a professor .
This is a professor .
Or this one is a CEO somewhere .
A CEO somewhere .
From the way they talk ?
Yea , because mostly , he has spent a lot of his time on the books-because right now , I think for you to : get to the level of a : being a professor , you 've spent a lot of times with books , con-written in English all that . So , when you now want to go to : -trace to-maybe : you wo n't use that simple register , you find it very hard . You 'll be straining a lot , cuz mostly you interact with people that you speak that language according to that particular context .
Is what-is what you have told me , uuh , possible kama huoni yeye mtu mwenye anaeongea ? Like-like that professor you are not seeing him . Or that village elder , you are just probably listening to radio , somebody talking-is it possible to gage level of education , without seeing the person ?
You 're-you 're-you are able to tell . If somebody speaks with-maybe speaks uuh , across , and you 're not-for instance may-maybe the radio , especially if you look at the media-the radio if somebody speaks , gives a statement , you are able to tell . For instance there is a time-sometimes back there were a lot of floods . There was a : -a : woman who really hit =
That notorious woman ( they both laugh )
" Tunaomba serikali , tusaidie- " You know you listen and you say like " Ey ! No , this one never went to- " and maybe when somebody speaks you are again able to tell-the way that person speaks you are able to tell at least this one had some education . So you are able to tell .
Mm mmh .
Apart from that , you are even able to trace their linguistic origin . You are able to tell " this guy speaking , this is a Luya speaking , this is a Luo guy speaking " , so you are able to tell .
Yea , ok .
Yea .
And uuuh , so you-you said you speak English , Kiswahili , Sheng , Dholuo .
Mm hhm .
So do you speak different languages to different people ?
Yea . I speak different languages to different people .
ALVIN RECORDING 2.1 ENDS . ALVIN 2.2 BEGINS ...
You said you-you speak different languages to different people .
Yea .
Mm hhm .
For instance when I -during the holidays when I get back to : my village ,
Yea .
I speak to my : grannies in Dholuo , in Dholuo purely .
Mm hhm .
When uuh maybe I meet-I go to : my former school , to the teachers , I use purely English to speak to them .
Mm hhm .
So again I have to-it 's like maybe I go to buy : kwa mama mboga pale ,
Mm hhm .
It will be like now that I 'm a Swahili or maybe I know English very well , I go there " how much are you selling tomatoes ? " you know-
Yea . Mmm .
So I have to like choose my words-I mean my language correctly .
Mm hhm .
And again when you are speaking to : my : dad , I have to like desert formal-I have to speak to him , using the correct language . Depending on how he starts the conversation . Yea . And again when I ’m speaking-for instance there are words I can use to : my friends , for instance somebody-you start talking to somebody and you- utamwambia , " Ah , we acha za ovyo ! "
Mmm .
Using Sheng . So you know you can n't use that to your dad or maybe somebody you =
Your lecturer , you professor .
Your lecturer , you professor . You can n't use that . Again when we are talking to , maybe my classmates , purely-to them I use purely Swahili . Pure . Kiswahili sanifu .
Mm hhm .
Yea . So I at times I do use-maybe I want an assistance at-maybe I 've gone to see a lecturer ,
Yea .
Kama ni : mhadhiri anayetufunza Kiswahili , nitazungumza naye Kiswahili sanifu .
Mm hhm .
Yea . So I do use .
So these-all these issues come into play when you are choosing a language to ss-to address somebody .
Yea .
Ookay . And have you ever tried to change the way you talk ? Anything about the way you talk ?
I think-definitely I 've tried changing ,
Mm hhm . Why ? Or when ?
Now , trying to change as in uh developing or : like ? -
Mmm , like-you-you maybe-maybe you have a model somewhere of somebody who speaks in a certain way . And you probably want to speak like them . Something like that , have you ? Have you tried that ?
Mmm , I 'd say that definitely I 've tr-aa-I have . Because when I came here , my first year , I think the Swahili I was speaking was different . So when you are taught by =
How-how different was it ?
Uum , utunzi wa sentensi :
Yea .
Istilahi nilizokuwa natumia : zilikuwa tofauti mno . I was not that good in Kiswahili . Sasa nilipokuja , tukaanza kufunza sasa tulikuwa wale wafu-tulikuwa tunafunzwa na : aah-wahadhiri wali-walikuwa ni Wa-Waswahili .
Mm hmm .
Sasa , walikuwa tuna-wanatufunza unaona " Eh ! Nyie wajamaa anavyozungumza Kiswahili . Kiswahili chake ni sanifu , anazungumza kwa ufasaha . Sasa unaona kwamba hata mi siku moja , nifike pale nizungumze jinsi anavyozungumza . Hasa , sana sana kuna profesa mmoja ambaye alikuwa anatufunza , Profesa Ugechi . Alinifunza mwaka wa kwanza . Sasa alipokuwa ananifunza Kiswahili anachozungumza unashangaa anakwambia mimi nilikozaliwa , mimi nilizaliwa kule Kisi . Sasa una-unaona kwamba kumbe mtu anayetoka jamii fulani ana =
So it is possible kumbe it 's possible to change .
Kumbe unaweza badilika hata mwenyewe uanze kuzungumza Kiswahili sanifu . Sasa nafikiri kwa njia hiyo nilijaribu-nibadilike niwe kama yeye .
Mm hmm .
Naam .
How about in-in eeh =
English ?
Circumstances that are not classroom related .
Circumstances that are not =
Outside there .
Outside classroom . Now I think , there are some people-for instance if you see the media personalities , utapata mtu anazungumza- for instance mimi , there 's one guy I really : - nilikuwa- I really like envy him . There 's a guy called Ferdinand Omondi , he comes from my backyard now .
Oh .
With him , he reports- anaweza zungumza lugha zote mbili kwa ufasaa .
Mm hmm .
If he 's reporting sports maybe at 7 , uh , he 'll talk purely atazungumza Kiswahili sanifu na , u-u-utaona labda kama hujamsikiliza anapozungumza Kiingereza , utasikia , " Huyu jamaa anafahamu tu " =
Kiswahili .
Kiswahili tu . Come at 9 , you 'll find Ferdinand speaking English fluently ( Interviewer yawns in the background ) . Na ukimuona huyo utafikiri huyu jamaa Kiswahili hakifahamu .
Mmm .
Kwa hiyo mara nyingi unaona-unaona huyu jamaa , I 'll one day like-want to : =
So you-mostly for you it 's about model . Some-you want to be like somebody .
Like somebody , yes .
How about your peers ?
My peers =
You can-like you want to : -to be like somebody who is your peer . Your-your-a student like you .
Yea .
Has that happened ?
Yea . Ii-ii-there 's a time it happened . For instance as now that I was speaking Swahili , nimepata kwamba kuna jamaa ambaye yeye Kiswahili-aah , maanake mimi mwanzo mwanzo nilikuwa na-nilikuwa nasumbuka , nilitatizika sana kwanza kuzo-kuwa na uzoefu . Kuzungumza Kiswahili . Sasa kunajamaa fulani , ambaye tunasoma naye , so jamaa yeye alizalika : -alizaliwa kule : Pwani .
Mmm .
Kiswahili chake ni kwamba anafahamu kabisa . Anazungumza kwa ufasaha . Sasa unamuiga unaona huyu jamaa siku moja mimi pia nizungumze . Ni-ni-nikuwe kwa lugha . Nizungumze jinsi anavyozungumza .
Na Sheng ?
Sheng-
Have you ever had uh-like you said there 's this weak , lighter Sheng and there is a strong one .
But =
And you said you speak the-the lighter one .
The lighter one .
Have you ever wanted to speak ?
Mmm , no with Sheng , I do n't think I 've-
No .
No . I 've never wanted to like be fluent in Sheng =
English ?
English I 've wanted to be fluent . I 've wanted to be fluent .
You have-you have seen somebody speak and you 're like " I want to -"=
Yea .
Have you tried to do that , to speak like somebody .
Yea , definitely . There was a guy when back in high school [ uncertain transcription ] he speaks English and you 're like " He ! This is the same guy that we-we 're in the same school ? " But he speaks differently , and very fluently .
Yea .
So you 're like " Mm ! I think I need-I also need to change " .
Mmm .
Yea .
So you try to do that .
You try doing that . Yea . And I think , in as much as at times you 'll be faking-you will be faking it but-[uncertain transcription]they say you fake it until you-{you make it }
{ you make it } ( they both laugh ) . So you have done that ?
I , at times I 've done that .
At times ?
Yea .
How about eeh : ... the issues that-kind of topics you are discussing now-in your hostel , with your-your-your students . What kinds of topics are-are of interest to you ?
Uuh , my topic of interest ?
Mmm . What are you talking about ? Like not just of your interest but what you talk about ?
Oh okay . Generally . Generally , in campus the-mostly in campus-one , people you will find instances people are talking about academics purely .
Mm hmm .
And I-I-I was doing that assignment I 've been like trying to search through the net , go through the books and it-nothing is forthcoming . So you know that is one , academics people will talk about .
Yea .
Another one is maybe sports . The transfer window is here , who is moving to ?
This is the premiere league .
This is the premiere league season . You will always hear about it .
Mm hmm .
Another thing is maybe politics .
And why do n’t people discuss about local football ? That much .
Local football , I think eh , the performance .
I do hear-are you a fan of any of the locals ' clubs ?
Mmm . I used to but not that much . I 'm not-[uncertain transcription ]
How about you-the English premiere league ?
English premier league I 'm a Manchester fan ( laughter by both ) . So you know =
( continued laughter ) I 'm also one so I 'm happy to hear that . Eh he ?
Anyways it depends now if you look at the local football , I think the performance is not up to the mark that somebody can envy to-you want to get involved .
Yea . Mmm .
For instance if you look at Harambee Stars , mostly nobody wants to be associated with the dissap-all the time it 's dissapointment-all the time [ uncertain transcription ]
You go to the clubs , Goromayags I see they are fighting , they throw stones-
Yeah so .
Ni nini hii kutupa mawe ? Why-why can n't we people do that ? Have you ever seen people throwing stones in the English premier league ?
No , I think the reason is that uh-mostly , our people are not disciplined . Discipline is really wanting there . Because-and then another thing , the Luos , the reason why I think there is so much-Luos and uh-maybe there are so-too much egocentric .
Mm hmm .
They want to win and if they do n't win-you-you know when =
They want to win at all cost .
At all cost . When you have high expectations and uh , you-you-you come in disappointing-disappointed , you tend to look for other ways of expressing your anger .
Mmm .
And the Luos already defined that in the stones .
Mm hmm . They 're using stones .
Using stones to like =
Throwing stones .
People , even innocent people they just-you like-you : really [ uncertain transcription] =
People who are not even involved in actually the football .
Yea , because seriously you 're disappointed , maybe you 've been beaten in a match . There are people travelling from work , you go into the streets cause a lot of trouble .
Why beat these people in the streets ? If there are people to be beaten =
You beat your opponents .
I think it 's the players .
Yea .
No , even your own players because they did n't-they did n’t perform .
They did n't perform well .
Or sack them or something .
Yea . So : =
Aah , what other topics ? Apart-you had said academics .
Sports , politics .
Politics .
Especially those =
[ uncertain transcription ]
No , especially politics people talk about the national politics-
Mm hmm .
Especially now that there are a lot of appointments , there are a lot of like-gov-there 's a lot of uuh , wrangles between the senate : and the national assembly : And now =
So you 'd be talking that with your people ?
Yea . People do talk about it . And another thing , especially after watching a news-you see after watching news you now start ta-analyzing . But-everything about it .
Mmm .
Another thing is politics , at the level : at the university level . Somebody comes and tells you , " Bwana : I want to- " Because right now elections are supposed to be-be-be held , probably at the beginning of next semester .
This is AMUSA ?
Yea .
Mm hmm .
So you find somebody tells you , " You know I have interest " . You now start talking you have interest and-like right now with me , I 've got like five friends who are vying for the same position . You approach-somebody else tells you-I equally have friends who want to-be the secre-gen . So how-how are you going to handle these people ? So you know you 're like , " Oh noo " . You 'll have to now like play it cool .
You do n't have an interest yourself ?
Noo . Politics =
You seem to be someone who can be : a good =
No .
Student leader .
Noo , politics has never been my thing . I do n't know why , uh , it has never been =
But you articulate-you e : -you express yourself very well-and I think that is the only qualification a politician needs .
No . Right now I do n't think that . Most people do n't look at that . Cuz for one , in-let 's say in campus ,
Watu wanataka nini ?
People for one , people will want you to associate you go to like-you associate with a lot of people , you like-when you go-when it 's maybe clubbing , you 're there clubbing buying people alcohol . If it 's maybe : , uuh , the match there , you 're there you 're watching with them you-which maybe-which I do . But apart from that , you 'll need to like-you know-oil their palms , [ uncertain transcription]it happens here .
Ah ! [ uncertain transcription ] It happens here ?! Wanafunzi wanapata wapi pesa ?
There are people who have uh-they give a lot of cash . Or maybe in the morning they tell you breakfast . Mm , you come into : =
" It 's on me . Just sit and " =
Just have breakfast . And at that particular point , because elections are held by the end of-they 're held at the end of the semester . When people are very broke . So they are able to compromise a lot . They easily compromise . ( laughter )
( They both laugh ) That 's interesting .
They 'll easily compromise . You 'll have to go to state , you 'll find people drinking-maybe it 's [ uncertain transcription ] , you give one thousand " Hey ! These people be served with bottles . "
Yea .
You go to another club , " These people should be served " So it 's like they 're singing-
Mmm .
Another thing =
So it 's a money business
It is .
Just like the way it is nationally .
It is .
Mmm .
And uh , the last one there were allegations that some students were sponsored by people who have interest in the shops . Somebody wants to =
Aah , because these students determine who gets the shop .
I see , this guy is likely to win , so let me be like a stakeholder .
A sponsor .
A sponsor in that . So money : is another =
Money changes hands ?
Yea .
Ok . So what are : -you are now in third year ?
This is my third year .
What are your plans after : you finish ?
Aaa , I would like uh-when I finish , I wanted-I take BA Kiswahili and I major in interpretation . Because us , in our faculty you can be : maybe you major in fasihi , lugha na isimu language and linguistics , au tasfiri na ukalimani . So mimi I di-I do translation . So I want maybe when I finish up , if I 'm able to get money-some finances , I come back for my masters but I wanted to do masters if I can get-I can now a different field , not translation I go to-now I do a media course .
Aa , but still in Kiswahili .
Yea . In Kiswahili . A media course in Kiswahili .
A media course .
Yea . Cuz aah-I 've been-I 've had that passion =
You have interest , for the media =
For the media .
Wewe you want to be like Ferdinand .
( laughs ) Whether it 's print or uh whatever the [ uncertain transcription] =
Whether it 's print or =
Whether it 's print or electronic media . Wherever . Here .
Mmm . Okay , all the best . And thank you for your time .
Okay , thank you .
Good .
