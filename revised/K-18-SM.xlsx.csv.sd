Dialogue
Soo [ uncertain transcription ] to start us off , maybe you would want to tell me which kind of language you : .. do you typically use with your family members or in your family ?
Okay in our family all of us are Luos and ,
Mm hmm .
And I ha-I have a : -all-our entire family
Mm hmm .
People are not that much learned to : -to understand English or Kiswahili .
Okay .
Okay . So it forces us to use eeh Luo language ,
Mm hmm .
Where many people in that region use . Yea , mm my parents uhh never went to school . They-they cannot even write .
Mm hmm .
So it forces me at times to use only Luo language and not eh , English or Kiswahili .
Okay .
They can understand Luo language better .
Mm hmm .
Yea .
So what , do you : -Okay , how about your brothers or sisters who maybe have gone to school and they can speak some English or Kiswahili ?
Okay I have a few brothers eh there are two brothers and two sisters . There are two brothers that are in Form One and Form Two .
Okay .
And the : -the other sisters are in primary school .
Mm hmm .
So at times English becomes complicated to use with them . So it forces me to use Kiswahilil language to speak to them .
Which you think is a bit easier for them ?
Yea it a bit easier to them . English is a bit complicated .
Okay .
Yea .
How about when you ’re with friends , which language do you use and maybe why ?
Okay , when I ’m eh : with my friends ,
Mm hmm .
I use English . I use English so that I can eeh appear a bit higher ( they laugh a bit ) .
Okay .
You know when-people-people do n’t like-they underrate Kiswahili .
Mm hmm .
They say Kiswahili is-is known mm by everybody .
Mm hmm .
So I use English even eh-when you ’re in class ,
Mm hmm .
The-the-ah my classmates they conference around ,
Mm hmm .
It-I use English so that I can appear a bit higher .
Okay .
Not when I use Kiswahili ( laughs ) I ’ll be like eh-a common person around . So it forces me to use eh : English language .
Mm hmm .
Yea .
Do you have friends maybe who may not understand English ?
Okay , I have-I h-I have-I have mm-I have many of them-many of them around here they cannot even speak eh-okay they try-they try speaking it but it 's not coming clearly . Sometimes it forces me to-to quit a bit from English and speak uh Sheng which they better-they understand better .
Okay . Why-why do you think uh these friends of yours who regard Kiswahili as a bit ... lower then maybe English . You said when you-you speak English you-you appear higher ?
Okay , English language , ( laughs ) , it is eh-it is related-they do relate it with the-the white men .
Mm hmm .
So when you speak English language , you appear like the white men , the : -okay , even the philosophers . The philosophers who were giving-who were quoting philosophy they quoted them using English language not Kiswahili .
Okay .
So in parliament when eeh our politicians are speaking ,
Mm hmm .
They use eh-many of them use English language . So when people [ uncertain transcription ] hear this they understand , that English is a bit higher then Kiswahili .
Mm hmm .
Yea .
Okay , now here in school which [ uncertain transcription ] language do you use ?
In school when I ’m uuh-I 'm in class ,
Mm hmm .
I use English language . But when I quit back to : -to the hostels ,
Mm hmm .
I do n’t use English because eh-many people now will think that I 'm eeh , he ! ( smiling ) I ’m trying to be-to be special and I ’m still a student . So it forces me to use Kiswahili ,
Okay .
Not English . English I use only when I ’m in class when I ’m relating with my major [ uncertain transcription ] like me .
Mm hmm .
Yea .
Okay . But are-are there times that you feel like using English maybe even back there in the hostels ?
Yea , when a-ooh when a : -mmm-when a friend of mine , for example a-a colleague whom you are doing the same course with comes to my hostel we : -we do use English language so that the people around may-may look at us ina-in another angle .
Okay .
Yea , they say these people really they are taking major , they do n’t take eeh other courses like human resource .
Okay . ( smiling )
Yea , so you use English only when people whom you are doing eeh the same course with comes to my hostel . Not just to anybody . Yea , because they say maybe you are-you are pretending . But that language is nno-the-okay they say the-the-the-they are not the-we are not the native of that language .
Mm hmm .
So we just force yourself to speak the language .
Mm hmm .
Yea .
Okay , so-so do you think then that um .. English is the-is the main language that is being used in the media or ?
Okay in eh-in many media industries ,
Mm hmm .
They do say that eeh when uh when you can speak English better ,
Mm hmm .
You have many chances than that person who can speak eeh Kiswahili . Because Kiswahili eeh-is just limited to certain stations .
Okay .
So then with me I ’m always proud when I speak English .
Mm hmm .
Because I know I 'm eeh-I ’m a bit differentiated with my colleagues who are-who only- who can only speak Kiswahili ,
Mm hmm .
Cuz I know mma-maybe I ’ll be very competitive with English , more than eeh Kiswahili .
Okay .
Yea .
So perhaps that eeh is the main reason that you-you think it ’s important for : -for one to learn English ... Or there are other reasons that might be-that might uh lead to one uuh wanting to learn English ?
Okay , there are other reasons .
Mm hmm .
For example when you know English you can speak English better .
Okay .
I think it will be even easier to relate with eehmm-okay majority of our-even our politicians ,
Mm hmm .
They do n't like speaking Kiswahili . I do n’t know why they-they like approaching people with English .
Okay .
And I think when you know English better you ’d be a good position to relate with these people .
Mm hmm .
Even our churches there are times-these uh wazungus -the white men from the .. -the wazungus from aah-from United States of America , from Britain . When they come to our churches the pastor-the pastor do ask atauliza “ nani hapa anaweza kuongea lugha apart from eh ana-anaweza-anazi translate from-from our native language Dholuo to English ? ” So it will be another opportunity for this English person to translate uh this language from Luo to English . And it will be easier and I th-I think they ’re-there are allowances they are given . So I think it 's better that 's another importance .
Okay .
Yea .
Mm hmm . So-so-so English , when you learn English you ’d be able to translate maybe aah-eeh-one language =
To another . Yea , I-it is very easy ,
Okay .
Because Kiswahili anybody can translate .
Uh huh .
Even the : -I-I-even my mother who never went to school but can speak ii-Kiswahili . They can speak eh not fluent Kiswahili but Sheng . But English he cannot , I am sure he cannot speak English . So I do rate English at a certain level .
Okay .
Yea .
Now talking about a native language . You-you said that your native language is uh =
Is Luo . Yea .
Okay . Do you think it is important then for one to learn a native language at least ?
Yea it is of much importance to learn native language . Because eeh well , when we leave this place we go back to the village … you will not speak English or you c-you cannot entirely speak English at times because you have friends who use-who used to-who you used to speak aah the-the Luo language with ,
Mmm hmm .
You have that old grandma in the village . So it is eeh-it is better if you can speak your language better .
Okay .
They do say this eh-they do say that eeh-any person who is ehh- who cannot speak his language then he is not a-a native of that language . I am sure , your language is the only one which will identify you . I 'm aa-I 'm not an English man but I like English but my language identifies me . No one is identified by either English or Kiswahili . So your language .
So you can speak your native eeh language fluently ?
I can speak it fluently . Yea and I know-I know it deeper even if whenever I go to : the village they ’ll greet me by my native language . I cannot pretend that I do n't know it cuz they ’ll be-they 'll begin asking many questions . Many will say that this man nowadays pretending and he was just a common umm person here . He has gone and aah gathered some knowledge now he ’s pretending that he can only speak English . I think it is better to speak your language .
So-s o-o kay for your case when you go there in the village and then you ’ve gone to school but you ’re still able to speak your native language . You see yourself fitting in the =
The community .
In the community .
Yea .
Okay . Those people , maybe there are those people who may not uh , be able to speak their native language in one way or another . What do you think these people miss in life that you yourself enjoy ?
Okay these people who cannot speak their native languages that some of us who are : - who are born and brought up in towns for example you ’ll find a gentleman who was born in town , brought up in town went to : primary school in town , went to high school in town .
Mmm hmm .
So he ’s not even aware-he 's not sure of where his homeland is . And he ends up speaking only Kiswahili of which I said Kiswahili you cannot be identified by Kiswahili because it is a national language . Everybody knows it you cannot say that you are- even people from Mombasa you do n’t identify them using Kiswahili cuz they ’re Mijikenda , the Pokomo all are from Mombasa .
Mm hmm .
So they have the other language they are supposed to speak . So these people who cannot speak their language I think they are even worse . Yea they are-the worst place because if you cannot speak your language , then it means you do n’t know where you come from and you cannot be-you cannot even say when you are asked which community do you come from because you will say-if you will say Luo or Luya they 'll-they 'll uuh-the-the first thing they do begin with is eeh , they send you a greeting so that you can-you can reply back .
You can reply .
And you ’d be in a tough situation if you will be not in a position to reply back . Because it 's the only thing which will identify you as a real person from that community . I think [ uncertain transcription ] the geographical , they call the geographic and awareness maybe you are brought up in a-in a Nairobi , or you were brought up in eeh these big towns . So all your life is just based in eeh the town , the-the metropolitan city so you cannot trace back to-to where-where uuh the father came from because when you were in Nairobi even the parents they do feel shy speaking uhh that lang-their language . They force themselves in speaking Kiswahili . So even the born-cuz uuh : … children , the kids they only talk the language which their parents are talking . If the parents are speaking Kiswahili they ’ll also speak Kiswahili and they end up speaking Kiswahili , up the time when they ’re old wh-when they ’re old people and they cannot trace back to where they were born . Where-where the parents came from .
Okay , you are aspiring to be : a great scholar .
Yea .
In life .
Yea .
Do you think there ’s any harm … if you learn the-the three languages . Do you think you ’ll become any less of a scholar if-if you can speak your native language at the same time you can speak Swahili , you can speak English , do you think it ’s of any harm ?
Okay the speaking of this language there ’s only one harm which I know .
Okay .
For example us Luos , speaking English at times become difficult if you-you can-you are fluent in your language . If you can speak eeh Luo language very clearly and eh-and you know it well , then speaking eeh English at times become difficult . Cuz even if you ’d be told to say “ shop ” you ’ll say “ sop ” . I think that ’s the only problem and the only disadvantage of knowing your : language , being a good speaker of your language . But then I think if all other remaining , it is good to know these languages . They can help you better . Even the kids that you ’ll bear . They ’ll-they 'll know that you came from this community and they , they ’ll iden-they-themselves they will identify themselves as either Luos , Kikuyus and others . So if you can speak your language better , it will not help only you but only the people who while come after you . Yea , it is better . Yea .
So far we have talked of Dholuo , English , Kiswahili and you:-you ’ve also talked of Sheng .
Sheng .
Now do you ever find yourself mixing in these languages in one conversation maybe ?
Yea , I do mix them .
Mm hmm .
Okay , here in uhh , in this institu-in the learning institution I meet many people from eeh many tribes . There are many Luos here . So at times when we : -we encounter each other , we can mix these three languages at times . I mix English , Kiswahili and Dholuo so that I can identify myself with them because I cannot identify myself as a Luo if I cannot speak Luo . But then you must speak English and Kiswahili because we are in a learning institution .
Okay .
So you mix them and aah we mix them at random . We can have a [ uncertain transcription ] from English and speak Luo a bit and again Kiswahili . Yea , I think eeh that 's better .
Mm hmm . When can you say do you often mix these languages ?
Okay =
[ uncertain transcription ] for what reasons ?
Okay why I do mix these languages . When I-I encounter for example these people . We are here in an institution of learning . I encounter them . I cannot only speak English cuz first I ’ll not identify myself as them-as aah-as a Luo cuz eh , we do identify ourself first before-we do ask ourselves where do you come from my friend ? This man tells “ I come from this place ” this one “ I come from this place ” . So I think it is of pride , you feel happy when you encounter someone from your place . So it ehh-when you mix it , you mix these languages you will understand each other better .
Okay .
Yea . Some-some-some-there ’s some eeh-for example these Luos some were brought in eeh-in Nairobi , they cannot speak it better . So and they want to know it because-they-they do n't un-they understand little of them . So when you speak it , you speak it with them . You can even make-make them to learn this language which they were brought up even in the town without knowing them . So we do mix them . We mix them-some of us-we mix them so that others can understand us better .
Mm hmm .
Yea .
So let ’s say you were con-conversing with somebody over the-the-the-the phone . And maybe you were speaking uuuh , English . Do you ever find yourself inserting some Luo words or Kiswahili words here and there , within the same conversation ?
Okay , when it begins with English , I just go with him up to the end and I just speak English up to the end . Unless if he is the one who will have quit from English . But I ’ll go with him so that I-even I can even prove my toughness to-for him .
Okay . ( smiling )
Yea . Because I-I started by-earlier by mentioning that when you speak English they guarantee you as tough .
Okay ( giggles )
Yea not Kiswahili . Yea , English makes people tougher . That ’s why even our lecturers speak , many of them speak English . Even the lecturers teaching Kiswahili they ’ve a quit from Kiswahili and speak English .
Okay .
Yea . So that they can appear a bit tougher .
Okay . Now you-you have admitted that sometimes you mix … two languages maybe in one conversation . Which of these languages can you say you tend to mix most ?
Okay mostly I tend to mix English and Kiswahili . Yea . English and Kiswahili . But aah , I 'll only mix the-the three-these three when there ’s a person who understands the third one better .
Okay .
Because you-I cannot mix it in class because I-I 'm not sure if everybody can understand the third language . So if I ’m sure we are two of us-or in a context-for example in a context of high school , many-high school which I went to many people were Luos , I can mix three of them because many people will understand it . But here I ’m not sure . It will force me to either speak English or Kiswahili which many people can understand better .
So you are saying you first consider your audience ?
Yea I consider my audience first .
Mmm hmm .
Yea .
Before you-you mix .
Before I mix them , I check the number-okay it is not a must that everybody here must understand it … maybe if it is just 95% I think it is better I can mix three of them .
Mm hmm .
Yea . If uhhh , many people here can understand it I ’ll just mix them so that the other people can translate it to the other : -other-the other few who cannot understand the third language better . Yea .
Are there instances in which you-you-you mix the-the two languages especially you mix Kiswahili and Dholuo or English and Dholuo in the hope of maybe locking out other people from the conversation that you ’re having ?
Yea there are many instances I can talk Luo language to-to lock many people from understanding eeh the-the-any-anything I saying . For example when we are ehh , we ’re in a group and a lady passes . Many , many gentlemen likes admiring these ladies that have passed . So when aah I ’m with the:-my-I ’m with a person who understands my language better and I want to explain to him that looker , that lady , we will use our language to lock other people from understanding this one . Yea . So that they cannot understand it better . I cannot speak English or Kiswahili because they ’ll understand it and they ’ll know . Yea . Of course English and Kiswahili if I speak everybody , every Tom , Dick and Harry will eh-will be in a position to understand it better . They can even laugh you . So you just use your language . Yea .
Okay . Now in the way you talk normally , in the way you speak . Have you ever noticed any difference between the way you speak and maybe how other students speak ?
Yea , yea . I-I-I ’ve noticed that other students ehh , for example there are aah some of my friends … whom uhhh , find it difficult to speak English .
Mm hmm .
Yea and I-I-I do-I do encounter them at times we speak English but I-they-they get difficult in speaking it until they have acquit and leave that language and they force me to speak Kiswahili now because speaking English they say it is very tough and they are the-they are not native of that language . So it forces me to quit from ehhh English . And the only language I can speak is Kiswahili . And if Kiswahili was not there then there ’s no language I cannot-I can-I can-there ’s no language I ’ll speak now . We ’ll-we ’ll just be silent . So the only option is Kiswahili .
Okay .
Yea .
If you compare the two languages or even the three languages : Kiswahili , English or even aah Sheng as you said . Which one do you say you can speak aah perfectly ?
Okay , I can speak perfect-perfect I can speak-speak English better . Yea better .
Okay .
Yea , then followed by Sheng . I cannot speak Kiswahili fluently cuz eehh , aah the rule of ngeli , I cannot match it better . I have a problem in eeh , in ngeli . Yea pengine naweza sema " kiti ambayo " na mwalimu wa Kiswahili atakwambia " ni kiti { ambacho } " .
{ Ambacho }
Yea , ambacho . I cannot speak it fluently .
Mm hmm .
Yea .
Okay . Now if-if you overheard somebody talking , can you tell that he or she is from your area from the way they-they talk ?
Yea , it is easy . I think it is eehm , the second method of identification after : our-after the-the-the appearance .
Okay .
You have the appearance , then the language . Okay , the language is eeh-is very easy for-for-for example me , I ’ll know-I ’ll know if I speak-whenever I speak English or Kiswahili . It is easier ff-for English to identify .
Okay .
For example if I want to identify these people from my place , they have a problem with ’ s ’ and ‘ sh ’ and you tell them to say " soap " -to say " shop " they ’ll say " soap " .
Okay .
Yea . Soo mm , I ’ll know jus-I-I ’ll just know you are a Luo and even in Kiswahili they ’re too fast in speaking Kiswahili . They speak it fast and wrongly . I ’ll just know that this man is from that place .
Okay .
Yea . And even the English is-is just plain . Plain and full of mistakes . I ’ll know this man is from that region . Yea , because that region English many people do n’t speak it . So they force themselves in speaking it to appear a bit higher .
Okay .
Yea .
You said that Kiswahili aah is one of the languages that can be spoken by nearly everybody . You al-you even talked of your mom being able to speak Swahili .
Speak Swahili .
But can you tell that such and such a person is speaking Swahili differently . And maybe can you locate the area that they-they come from from the way they speak Swahili . Even if it is just the same same Swahili they are speaking ?
Using Kiswahili to locate ?
Yea , using Kiswahili to locate the area of-that somebody comes from .
Yea it is easy . For example people from Mombasa it is easier or very easy to know that these people are coming from Mombasa the way they speak Kiswahili . Yea . They can say " mi mwenzangu sitaki " badala ya " mimi " . Another person from Luo atasema " mimi mwenzangu sitaki " . Ye atasema " mi mwenzangu sitaki " .
Mm hmm . Okay .
Or she appears very fluent in this language when-when she speaks it . You just know this man is from Mombasa .
Okay .
Yea and the other people even from-people from even Nyanza , they-they speak it word by word , word by word . Yea so they fear making problems so they-they-they speak it word by word . And people from Mombasa speaks it once in a line and fluently . Yea .
So-so then in your opinion people who come from the coast can speak Swahili better then =
Yea , they speak it better than anybody else in Kenya . But-but English [ uncertain transcription ] . Yea .
How about this person who has gone to school and maybe this person has studied Swahili throughout . You know Kiswahili is-is his or her specialization . Can you still tell the difference between that person and another person from the coast who speak the same Swahili ?
Okay this person who has learned ehh Kiswahili and he knows more of Kiswahili . I think differentiating , the only thing which differentiate him from : -differentiate him from this person from the coast is just the tone now .
Okay . So it ’s the tone .
The tone , yea . The tone . The tone of a-of a speaking . This person who has learned it will speak it fluently without making mistakes but the eeh other person from the coast though he ’ll make a little mistakes but the tone , the tone matters a lot .
Okay .
Yea . The-the tone differentiate the two-these two people .
Okay .
Yea .
If you just ha-umm-heard somebody maybe over the radio . You have not seen this person . Can you tell what level of education they-they had ?
On the radio ,
Mmm hmm .
Yea I can tell . On the radio if it is English , it will be even easier to know . It is only complicated in Kiswahili . But eeh , English it is not a joke . Yea , you cannot just speak it and people , you confuse people that you ’ve learned it but you ’ve not , it is a must for English that you must know it deeper so as to confuse people . People will start wondering “ this man where did eeh-where did he-where did he knew all this ? He uses many vocabulary and eeh-and-and ehh-and new words . ” But in Kiswahili … no one can-no one can-you can confuse many people because no one will b-no one can really know this-whether this man he got learned somewhere , he learned Kiswahili or not because eeh the way you use it , the way you use Kiswahili is the way it is used everywhere because you cannot complicate Kiswahili . It is difficult to complicate it .
Okay . But with English ?
English you can complicate and you can speak . For example this man called PL or Lumumba , I think he do complicates English to the extent that eeh the common person cannot understand him better . But with Kiswahili you can-even the-the-the-the young kid can understand whatever you are saying . Yea .
May-maybe apart from the kind of vocabulary that this person would use , what other aspects of English would differentiate the common usage of English from any other person who has not gone to school and any-and that person who has really learned English ?
Okay , it is eeh , the pronunciation of words . For example , this man who has gone to school will say " institushen " instead of " institution " .
Okay .
Yea , I think it ’s the pronunciation of words . It will differentiate people . A person who has gone to school and learned a lot of English cannot pronounce the : " institution " as " institushon " . He will express himself so that people can understand him . He-he can complicate things so that people can get complicated and wonder " Okay these people , where did this person learn this language ? "
Okay .
Yea .
So on the same note can you also tell the-the position that this person falls in the society ?
The position ? Yea it is eh-it is really easy . Because eeh when you are-you are speaking English leave alone Kiswahili , it is English , people fears you . Yea , they really fears you because it a-it 's Eng-it 's a language , it is very difficult for people to talk . They fear it and they respect it . So when you speak it , and ehh , you can confuse people using this language . Okay many speakers of this English language they do mention even some words when they ’ve confused people they can even mention some vocabulary which are not in the dictionary just to confuse people further . ( both laugh ) . So I think they-their stature in the village or in the community is very high . And even if they want to-to vie for a seat it will be very easier . Because they believe , they believe in that person can even address the president .
Okay , so maybe if you were in a-in-in a-in a congregation in which people just speak and they do n’t like reveal who they are , who they really are maybe their profession , what they do in the society , would you be able to tell even without them mentioning ?
Without them mentioning ?
Mmm hmm .
They ’re just ehh , the people are just there ?
Yea .
No one has spoken or they have spoken ?
They have spoken .
They have spoken ?
Yea .
It is easier to tell . Yea , I can tell , I can really tell it-very easy . Yea , the-the-the mode of speaking I will just be keen on how you speak . There are those people who are eehh , find it difficult in even terming certain terms mentioning certain terms is a-a hard task for them . But there are these people of even whom you can write a difficult word , they can pronounce it at once and eeh , they can - they differentiate-the-the-they differentiate themselves from these people who mention terms one by one , one by one . I think I can differentiate it using that mode easily .
Okay .
Even the more the speed of speaking these languages . The speed matters a lot .
Okay .
A person who knows these languages speaks it very faster , then a person who is not-who-who is not learned in this language .
Okay .
Yea .
So-so on the same note … uhhh can you tell that this is a pastor speaking , this is a-a doctor speaking and this is maybe a common man speaking . Even if they spoke the same , same kind of English ?
Yea , I can tell . Yea , I know-I know the language spoken by : -by journalists I can tell it better .
Okay .
I know the pastor ’s language and I know the doctor ’s language . The doctor is a bit-a bit polite in his language .
Okay .
He is used to politeness with the patient . So it-it forces him to be polite everywhere . Yea . And eehh , for example even a policeman-a poli-a policeman his language , he appears tougher . And he ’s- he orders-he-he-he-he orders everything . He do n’t eeh , request .
Okay .
For a pastor , I know a pastor at times he requests , do n’t orders . Yea , the-the-the language he uses is for requests not orders . Yea , so I can differentiate a doctor and a-and a journalist . Yea .
How about the political affiliation . Can you tell that this-this person is affiliated to such and such a party ? From the way they talk even if you did n’t see this t-t hese people ?
Yea it is easy . It is very easy . For example the : the-the term they begin with , you can hear them speaking of “ ODM ” before they begin speaking . Or they even mention the names of the party leaders while speaking . It is very easier to know that this man is from this party . Or even the examples they give . For example the prime minister when he was campaigning , he used to give examples back with " the fish , the fish " . He referred to certain members from Rift Valley as “ mbota ” and eh , so I can know this man is from Nyanza and Nyanza is for people who are CORDed . So I can tell this man is a member of CORD . Yea . There ’s no single situation where-where you will hear Ruto making examples using fish . Yea .
Okay . So a-apart from the-the-the words they use how else can you identify that they are affiliated to such and such a party ?
Okay maybe : … if I aah , I have the knowledge that people from Mombasa that they support this party . So basically when you speak the : -that language of aah , Mom-p-people of-from Mombasa I know how they speak .
Okay .
So when you ’ll speak , you ’ll speak like them , I ’ll know you come from aah , this party . Cuz many people from Mombasa come from-I ’ll just assume because many people from aah Mombasa they ’ve come from this party . Yea .
Okay . Do you ever speak different languages to different people ?
Yea . I do speak different languages eeh , for example I ’m not a-I ’m not a : -a Kalenjin speaker but I know the mode of greeting “ chamgei ” . Whenever I meet them I encounter them I just try to tell them “ chamgei ” that I can appear that I know this language like them but in real sense I do n’t know it .
Mmm hmm .
Yea and eeh-even our language I use it when I encounter people from my place . I use Kisu-Ki-I use Kiswahili , I -I do use it to basically when we are in class with Kiswahili , when we are in a Kiswahili class I-I-t-I force myself to use it and eh-and eh-and eh even get concerned about the problematic ngeli . Yea , that 's the only place I can use Kiswahili better but English I can use it everywhere . Yea . Because of its superiority over other languages .
Okay , so what motivates you to use one language and not the other ?
Use one language and not the others ?
Or what reason makes it aah-makes you to use one language not the other ?
Okay first … what makes me to use eeeh one language , I prefer other , then the other , is the … I mentioned the superiority of a language . There are certain languages who are eeh , certain languages which people guarantee as superior to others .
Okay .
So I use one which is superior than the other , or appears superior . Again I use it when I-whe-when people who-when people around cannot under-cannot-when people around understand that language . Is only when I ’ll use my language . Or I-I ’ll use it just to confuse people ,
Okay ( smiling ) .
who do n’t understand it better . Yea I speak it to confuse people so that we can-we can be very secretive in our communication .
Okay , so eehm-and have you ever-you said that you speak differently from other people .
Yea .
Now have you ever tried changing the way you talk ? You said Kiswahili normally gives you problems , have you ever tried changing the way you talk in Swahili maybe ?
Yea I ’ve tried but eeeh … the problem is consistent . Whenever I try speaking it eeh , the fluent Kiswahili people begins to laugh so it forces me to quit from that language and eh , and use either Sheng or the English . Yea .
Okay . So oh-uh-what makes you want to change the way you-you-you talk ?
I talk-okay when I encounter people who speaks Kiswahili better-I think you cannot just speak English where people are speaking Kiswahili . It will force you to quit from eeh your language ( smiling ) and speak so that you can identify yourself with these people . Okay when they are speaking Kiswahili they-they-they-they assume they are superior . So if you want yourself also to be superior just speak the language they are speaking . So it will force you to quit from and leave other languages and try speaking the languages which people are speaking .
Mmm hmm .
Yea .
Okay . At this age , how far do you … think you would change your language . Especially maybe Kiswahili that you ’ve said it normally gives you problems ?
Okay this far , eeeh , I think I ’ll eeh-I ’ll not-I ’ll not make any change because I ’ve tried for long and eeh the problem has been consistent . So I eeh-I was planning that when I qui-I leave this place I think eeh I ’ll leave the matter of Kiswahili . I ’ll either speak Sheng , English or eeh , my language . Cuz Kiswahili has been very problematic whenever you speak it people laughs . So I ’ve given hope with Kiswahili . Yea , because I-there ’s no place I ’ll speak it again and especially [ uncertain transcription ] in broadcasting using English not Kiswahili .
Okay your coming to a higher institution of learning , do you think it has changed the way you talk in any way ?
Yea it has greatly changed . Yea , when I-when I came here I could speak English but eeeh , it was-it was-it was not-it was also a bit tougher . It was tougher but I ’ve improved with time . I ’ve encountered eeeh , the lecturers and the-how they speak and I admire the way they speak . I found myself imitating how they speak and I-I-I rose to be a good speaker of English . Yea .
Okay , so what aspects … have you changed whe-whe-did you change when you came ?
Okay for example the pronunciation . Where I come from people-people they say " shop " instead of " soap " . I was also-I-I-I also had that problem but a-at-at this end I cannot make that problem again it has really changed .
Okay .
Yea even the speed of speaking . I was very slowly speaking that language you ’ll be speaking and people will be waiting they ’ll tell you to continue , continue . Yea but I can now cope with their speed . Their words I can-I can-I can speak it very fluently and eh-and the speed is very high they can get it better . Not to confuse them but they get it better . And they appreciate . Yea .
So um , what aspects or what issues do you and your friends talk about nowadays ?
Okay when we are-are at school here we like talking about these movies . We can talk about the movies we watch , the horror movies . You ’ll find the-you 'll find that som-some of us fear horror movies , some of us likes them , some of us like the-the-the movies where people are killing themselves , some of us like the Nigerian movies . So people are very different . So we speak of-we can talk of movies . We can speak even of the lecturers . We can : speak of our : aspirations . Some of us speak that they-they-they do discvoer that they want to be the best reporters to win certain awards . They term that OGW award , I do n’t know more about it . So we do interact and speak about it many people can speak of people , the successful people , they admire them . Yea .
Okay . Now talking of movies , which kind of movies do you watch maybe .. Eng-eh-English or those in Swahili ?
Okay , I-li-li-I Iike watching eeh the Nigerian movies which many people do n’t like so a-a- at times it forces me to hide so as to watch it better because eeeh , they do say Nigerian movies are for ladies but I like them . So it forces me at times to hide from these people and watch it entirely . Cuz many people like Indian movies .
Okay .
But I do n’t like much of them . It forces me at times to hide from them and watch it better . But a-all the same I can watch them I-I-I can watch a-any . Yea but I like Nigerian movies more than any other . Yea .
So y-can you tell that this is a Nigerian accent of maybe English ?
Yea it is-it is easier . A person from Nigeria knowing him you can know him using the name , I know they call-they call-they are Ogobuefi , there are-the-the-the funny names they are easy , Obi , they are easy . ( both laugh ) . Or the kind of English they speak . Yea , they speak English better then the-they speak English compare that white man but they are black Africans . I think the only country in Africa where people speaks English like uuh , the white men . So it is easy to know-to know them , just by the language and even by their appearance .
Okay . You said your friends-you said you and your friends like umm , talking about your aspirations and you-talking about your role models in life ? Now what can you identify as their attributes , especially when it relates to language , that you like about them ?
Okay , for example if I ’ll give an example of a-of a this-this man is called Johnson Mwakazi in Citizen . I think the-the way he speaks language is very encouraging . The English language . I doubt if he can speak Kiswahili . The English he speaks it even forces some young men who are aspiring to be journalists to imitate ,
Okay .
the way he speaks . Yea . So I think this man is making many people to be very proud .. of speaking eeh English . And I think at the end many people will speak from Kiswahili and will be speaking English so as to appear like that man . Yea .
So Johnson Mwakasi what-how does he speak that makes it peculiar from-from the rest of the journalists ?
That man terms the-the words , how he reads the words ( he laughs , they both laugh ) , I think he attracts the attention of people . A person may be seated watching news but instead of watching news he ’ll be just learning how-how-how to-to-how to term certain words-the pronunciation from this man . Instead of watching news , as if you are taught English . Yea , even the way he reads he has never made a mistake in reading this eeh-this text . Yea and they like the-that ’s why they like the-the-they prefer him anchoring news than others .
Okay . Now-now do you uuh , like reading novels ?
Yea , I do read them .
Mmm hmm .
Yea I like =
What kind of novels ?
I like reading novels and for example the : the Chinua Achebe novels I like them . Yea they are eeh very encouraging . The-the English used there I think they assist me in building my language . I prefer reading novels tha t-t he English novels . Yea . I like reading many of them . I can read them even for a day I can clear a novel .
Okay , so you said you study media . What do you aspire to be in the future ? Do you want to be a photojournalist , do you want to-to be a writer ? [ uncertain transcription ]
Okay , I ’m-I ’m aspiring to be : a reporter .. cuz I ’m aah-I want to be a reporter first , then in-in building my language they do promote people using language . Yea , I ’ll build-I 'll build my English language in the-as I ’ll be reporting then aah , they ’ll eeh-they ’ll after-after I ’ll improved in the language I think they ’ll eeh-they ’ll make me to another level of aah an anchor . When you ’re good in language they take you to another level . So : they ’ll take me to an anchor . And from an anchor I think you can be among the-the best people who are speaking-the best people of English speaking , yea .
What does it take to be a reporter ?
To be a reporter they-they check many things . For example they look at eeeh , your language . I was told they check aah-they-they-they really check at your language . Can you speak without referring to-to any-any-any-any document ? Reporting until just speaking , you report without referring back to any document . You cannot write something and report back . After that they ’ll eeeh-you ’ll go to the-the-the level of an anchor where now you can read it because you-even if the writer the editor made a mistake you can correct it on the way of -whil-while you are anchoring you can correct it cuz earlier you used to report without referring to any-any document . Yea .
So to that [ uncertain transcription ] , I think we have come to the end of this session of the interview . And I really appreciate you for having aah been available .
Okay I do-I appreciate you and I-I ’ve-I ’ve liked this session . Yea .
And the-the kind of information you ’ve given me will play-uh go a long way to assist in furthering the objectives of this-of this research .
Yea , I believe-I believe you ’ll go-you ’ll-you 'll make it to higher levels cuz as this man Martin Luther King , Jr. put it , that whatever is in a man’s mind he can be . And I know whatever is in your mind then you can be-you can be that person or that thing that is always in your mind . I believe you can make it . Yea and I can make it too .
You can also make it =
I can make it !
As a journalist . ( laughing )
Yea and be a good journalist !
That has been your-your slogan .
Yea , my aspiration . Yea .
That you can =
I can make it whatever is in my mind basically I know I can make it . Yea .
