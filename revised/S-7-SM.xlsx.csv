LF: the Participant shifts the power relations between him and the Interviewer by asking him a question- ""I can pose this question to you Sir"". Also, this indicates the Participant's expertise and confidence strong enough to turn around and interview his Interviewer. He does it in a respectful manner by using the word ""Sir""."

Think about a person <english>who dropped out from school, he- he- he dropped out as I was making an example- we were talking about teenage pregnancy, the guys were saying, the girls have a</english> choice <english>to get pregnant. Me I say</english> think about a person <english>who grew up in an environment where her mother is not working, her father is not working, her brother also is unemployed. She is studying,</english> let’s just say <english>she is doing grade ten, perhaps her only friend, time she spends with her and she is also not at school, perhaps she also dropped out of school. Please consider for me this person perhaps she is dating a cab conductor, he gives her money, he gets her pregnant so she can get welfare grant money. If you think what this person- what else does this person has in her mind apart from what surrounds her?</english> Coz I think for you to think differently, <english>you have to- you have to spend or you have to be in a place that will make you think the way you want to become tomorrow.</english> Coz I think to be something tomorrow <english>you have to start now=</english>",,"SM: Expertise.
