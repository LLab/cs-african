So , welcome for this session of discussion about , from- eh , language use .
Yeah .
So we 'll be discussing issues to do with your use of language .
Oh , okay .
So how many languages do you know , if I may ask ?
Uh , to start with my mother tongue =
Which is ?
Kipsigis dialect of the Kalenjin tribe .
Yes .
Then English , Swahili , then I also know a bit of French . Though speaking personally there 'll be difficult . =
But you can understand .
I 'm more comfortable with written . And =
Written you are- you are good .
Yeah , I 'm more comfortable with that .
Okay .
Then there 's also these uh … kalocal language known as Sheng .
Oh , you are also good in that ?
Not really good , but just a bit of it .
Okay .
Because it keeps on evolving .
Yeah , so =
It changes everyday .
Mhh . In our discussion , just feel free to use any of those languages .
Mhh , okay .
Yeah , feel free . You are not restricted to any language specifically . So I want to- which language do you typically use with your family ?
It is Kalenjin .
Kalenjin ?
Yeah , [ uncertain transcription ] that = Kipsigis dialect .
So that would be Kipsigis dialect . When you are at home with your family , that 's what you use .
Yes .
So that would be your parents ?
Yes . My parents with my =
Ehe . Brothers and sisters ?
Yeah , yeah .
You will use =
Brothers and sisters , use Kalenjin .
E eaa ! Like all the time ?
Yeah , all the time , basically all the time .
Basically all the time .
Yes .
E ee . Why do you use Kipsigis ?
Uhm , it is how we were brought up =
Because I 'm sure =
We were brought up talking that language .
Okay .
So when we come to learn about English and Swahili , when we went to school .
But I 'm sure your parents know Kiswahili ?
They really know , yes , but it would be difficult communicating with them in Swahili because , uhm , they 'll not just be comfortable talking to me .
Mhh , yehe . How about now your brother [ uncertain transcription ] your brothers . You have brothers ?
I have- I have a brother who just cleared high school last year .
Is there any other sibling ?
Yeah , there- there- there is another brother in class 7 , and I have a sister in class 6 .
So I 'm sure those ones will even speak these colloquial language your talking , Sheng .
Kweli .
Wo n't you sometimes talk some Sheng ?
I- I sometimes talk with my brother , the- the one who is- who just cleared form V last year . But =
Because you are a bit close in terms =
I do n't know =
age ?
Yeah , in terms of age . But we are not close on a personal level . I really do n't understand him as much as I understand my friends who I 'm with here .
Mhh .
So depending- because of that , the language that I use to talk to him , it is that Kalenjin .
So even these young ones they are fluent in it [ uncertain transcription ]
[ Uncertain transcription ]
They are good .
Yes .
Haa . Okay .
I really do n't know why . I do n't know if it 's because of the age difference that I do n't speak to him in Sheng . But with my peers , I do talk Sheng a lot , even when I 'm home .
Yeah , let 's talk about those peers , those friends now at home , okay ? Which languages or language do you use with them ?
That is uh , Swahili and Sheng , mixing English and Swahili .
And eh … how about Kipsigis at home ? I 'm sure these with the =
With my peers , not really that much of Kipsigis , but more of the Sheng and Swahili .
And Kiswahili .
Ee . Yes . It is =
So wh =
what identifies us . The = it identifies us as a group .
As- as a youth .
Belonging to that certain group . So if you come in and start talking uh- uh- Kalenjin or English , you 'll- you 'll be considered and outsider . So it is a form of identity for the group .
So , normally when you meet , that 's what you 'd be talking Sheng ?
Yes .
But when- what about when your parents are around and your friends have come visiting ?
We now switch to a language that they 'll understand .
That they 'll understand .
Which is Kalenjin .
Mh hhh . Do n't you sometimes have things that you do n't want them to hear ?
Many times .
Many times ? ( Smiles )
Yes .
So what do you do when you do n't want your parents =
For example , we even have coded language .
Coded language that is not Sheng ?
It 's not Sheng , it 's not- it is Kalenjin , but it refers to- it has a meaning , but the- the meaning that you have accorded it is different from the- the meaning that is =
The real meaning .
the real meaning of that word .
So your parents will not understand ?
They 'll not understand .
It 's Kalenjin .
Yes .
but they- they can n't understand .
They 'll not understand totally .
E ee . So it 's only between you .
Yeah , it is only between =
And this code , how did it develop ?
Uhm … I really do n't know because I also got it from somebody else .
Oh , so it 's something also that has =
It something that has been passed from somewhere .
Passed from - okay .
And it 's also regionally . For example , in- we can have a certain code in Bomet , which will not be there in = Kerito .
So , they say in this code would be … only- only Kipsigis ?
It 's not- oh- okay . It 's not restricted to Kipsigis , but mai- mainly it is in Kipsigis .
Mainly in Kipsigis .
Yeah , mainly .
Are some- a few Sheng words , =
Yeah , a few Sheng words .
A few Kiswahili words . Okay .
But I can call it a " Sheng of Kalenjin . "
A ao . Okay . Because Sheng is usually known as Kiswahili and English , a kind of mixing of- of- of the two . So , there 's also another one with now , eh …
So it can be- it can be that word =
Kipsigis and ?
that word which everybody knows the meaning , but you 've assigned it a different meaning .
So they try to follow the conversation , they- it does n't make sense to them .
Yeah , it wo n't make sense to them .
Hee , okay . So that is with your friends at home ?
That 's with my friends .
How about your friends in school ?
My friends in school , we 'll- because we are a mixture of different types , now we use Sheng , English and Swahili .
Mixture of English and Kiswahili .
Yes .
Why- why do you do that ?
There 's=
Why not just use English ?
English , you know it depends on the setting that we are in . Uh , because we 'll- now- it 's used for interaction . We 'll use- we 'll tend to use a language that you are more comfortable with . It 's a = it identifies also that peer group .
So , you feel more comfortable .
More comfortable when you are with that- that peer , peer group . And I remember when I was in first year , speaking to somebody like a fourth year . I 'd also see the way they are dressed , just from their physical appearance = I 'll know which language to use .
A aa !
If you are wearing , like the way I ’m wearing official dress =
A tie and ah …
Somebody will come and talk to me in English , officially , just because of the way I represented myself .
That 's an- uh , yeah [ uncertain transcription ]
[ Uncertain transcription ] Even right now when I was coming in here , I met somebody who talked to me in English .
Ee , they might even think probably this is a young professional =
Yeah , this- this is a young professional of something . So , they 'll use that formal language , not to offend you if they speak =
But at least sometimes put on jeans and t-shirts ?
Uh , nowadays I do n't . But in first year I used to .
But you used to do that .
Yes .
And when you put on that , people will talk to you =
They 'll tend to use that ghetto language , which is Sheng .
Which is Sheng .
Because they- they- they just that perception that you- you are someone that is conversant to Sheng , even when you are not , because of the presentation of what you are wearing .
And do you think it 's important for somebody to- to know English ?
Yeah , it 's very important , especially in this setting that we are in right now . English , you will use it a lot in =
You mean now in academic setting ?
In academic setting . So we- when you go to apply for a job , you 'll- the- there 's official language , English . Most of the books are in English . Most of the written material even on the internet , just in English .
You do n't- you rarely find a textbook in Kipsigis .
In Kipsigis or they 're even hard to access , even if they are there , they are very few . Reading- reading Kipsigis and speaking it are two different things . So you- for me , it 's hard to read a- a text in Kipsigis . But speaking it , I speak it fluently .
You speak it very fluently .
Yes .
What 's the problem with- Why can n't you- why is it easier to read English ?
Uh , I think it 's because of the practice , since- since- since =
School
Since , uh , nursery school , you 'll just be doing English , English , English . Basically = because of the practice .
So you are- Mh hhh . But your- with your Kipsigis , the practice is spoken .
Yeah , practice spoken .
Because you speak a lot of it .
Mhh . Yes .
So it 's not- it does n't have a- a written kind of tradition or …
Yeah .
As opposed to- to English .
It 's only the bible that we get the Kalenjin . [ Uncertain transcription] =
But I 'm sure- do you own a bible ?
Yeah-
I 'm sure it will be an English one .
Definitely .
( Both laugh ) Not a Kipsigis one ?
Yeah .
O , okay .
Even most sermons are in English . Go to any church =
Even in the village ?
There will- will they- nowadays translate because , because of these uh- people have moved in from different regions . They now come to- to live in those places .
So it 's not only Kipsigis people living there ?
So it 's not only Kipsigis who live in that place . So even if they use Kipsigis , there 'll be a translator .
Oh , okay . So English is important .
English is ni important .
Mhh . Mo- mostly for academic and according to what you are saying , and ?
Academics , even in interaction .
And job . Interaction ? Interacting with who ?
Even interacting with people . There are certain people who- who 'll not have a grasp of- uh , the Kiswahili or Sheng . So talking to them , you 'll use English .
What kind- give me an example .
Even we are- for example , we have foreigners visiting . The only language that they might be understanding is English . So , that 's the language that we are going to use .
Okay , later you 'll tell me with what people you are- use English with .
Okay .
Eh … How about Kipsigis ? Or any other native language , is it important for anyone to know these native languages ?
Yes , it is .
Why is it important ?
Uh , first of all , it is- it identifies you to a certain group and gives you that sense of belonging . For me , the Kipsigis language gives me an identity as a- I ’m a Kipsigis . And what do I have to show for it ? I can speak the language . That 's an identity . So , I 'll get that sense of belonging , such that when I go to my hometown , when people speak , I 'll not be left out . I 'll be understanding everything that they are saying . So that is the main reason =
Any other reason ?
so it 's for communication , basically . Also it 's for communication , identity . Yes .
And eh … I mean- if- if somebody does n't speak a mother tongue , I but they 're- I know people who do n't=
Yes . Several- several people , yeah .
I-does it mean that they do n't have an identity ?
Not really . There 's- it does n't mean that they do n't have an identity , but that sense of belonging , they 'll feel they are left out . For example , sometimes when- when we are in a hostel . I have a friend who is a Kalenjin , but he- he does n't know how to - he does n't have a- that competence with using the language .
With using the language .
So when we- we- he comes to our room sometimes , and my roomate is also a Kipsigis and he 's fluent in Kipsigis . So at time we use the language more , and this guy will just be left floating . He 'll not be getting anything .
He can n't follow . E he .
So , he 'll=
Yet , he 's a Kalenjin .
Yet , he 's a Kalenjin . So , what he- what he does is become irritated and tells us to use a language that he can understand . Because he does n't know if you are back-biting him or saying bad things about him .
So you think it 's a disadvantage for somebody =
It 's a disadvantage yes .
not to know a native language ?
Ah , at least you 'll need to have a grasp of one to a few words .
Mhh . What of those people born , bred and living in Nairobi ? Just like Nairobi . Is it that important ? They do n't even have a- a what you call a =
For them , yeah , for them because , uh , if they never have to be in situations where they- they are supposed to use the language , it 's not as important . If they are born and bred there , it is okay for them to have that knowledge of English and Swahili only .
And have that as their identity .
But- yeah . But if they have to be going to that village , then they really have to give it purport =
Otherwise , they 'll have problems .
Otherwise , they 'll have problems . Especially communicating with those people who 'll not have that knowledge of English or Swahili .
Do you find yourself mixing the languages that you know in the same conversation ?
Yes , but it depends on the context .
Mhh . Give me examples of when , for example , which context and why ?
If , if I 'm- if I 'm - if I ’m with my friends , I " l use English , Kiswahili and Sheng .
Mixing them ?
Mixing them . It does- it does n't- okay , if sometimes , it 's uh- because of uh- trying to make something more understandable , clearer . Or if I 'm telling a joke , there are some jokes which you can n't translate . You just have to say it with that mother tongue , otherwise you 'll lose the meaning when you translate .
So , Kipsigis . Will you mix Kipsigis with something else ?
Kipsigis , Swahili , English .
Yeah ?! You mix all the three of them ?
Very comfortably .
E ee ! Okay , but then that 'll be mean that you are speaking to a Kipsigis .
A Kipsigis . Yes .
What do you do with somebody who 's not …
Somebody who 's not Kipsigis ?
Yeah , Kipsigis .
Yeah , Kiswahili , English na Sheng .
But do n't you get mixted up sometimes if …
Not really .
Not really . Mhh . The situation =
Because I have that understanding of the language .
Mhh .
Okay . You 'll also have to consider this : if the person is your peer , I 'll use that code switching and mixing very easily . But if it 's somebody who is senior , I " ll tend to use formal language which is Swahili or English . Yeah , not mixing the two . Yes .
For somebody who is senior ?
Yeah , somebody who is senior .
For your peers , you can mix English , Kiswahili and Kipsigis .
Yes .
Okay . And for those who do n't speak Kipsigis , it 's English and Kiswahili .
Yes .
Mhh . So this happens how often ?
It 's very often .
Very often . Every day ?
Every day I do that .
Mhh .
Yeah . Even when I 'm speaking to young children , there 's a language that I use to suit their- the young child . Because- uhm , for example in terms of vocabulary , I 'll tend to use a simple word , simple sentence constructions and shorter sentences , when I 'm- I 'm speaking to a child .
Is that- is there- is that notion , is it the same for kwa marafiki - your friends , marafiki zako , your peers , is it the same that sometimes you use some simpler kind of mixing because this- this Sheng can also be complex and simple . [ Uncertain transcription ] unaona [ uncertain transcription ] kama hivi ?
Yes , yes , yes . I remember an instance . For example , there- now watu wanazaliwa town , you 'll tend to assume , nikimwongelesha hivi , ataelewa Then there 's this guy whom you see as kind of does n't understand this Sheng sana . So , you 'll- you 'll- you 'll- there 's a way you 'll speak to him too . Sitatumia ile ya maneno magumu sana . Ama tumia =
Kwa hivyo kuna tofauti ?
Yeah , kuna tofauti pia =
Kati ya- vile - I mean- wewe una- unazungumza ama some students talk with the others . [ Uncertain transcription ] there are differences ?
Yes , there are differences . Like I have a friend , I have my roomate . Anatoka interior part of Narok County . So the Sheng that he speaks , is not the Sheng that another friend of mine who comes from Nairobi speaks . And it 's not the English that that person will speak .
O ohh .
So there 's a way that I communicate with them , totally different .
Totally different .
I 'll use simple English when talking to him . Or simple Sheng .
So you- what you are telling me , is that it is possible for you to change the way you talk yourself depending on whom you are talking to .
Depending on whom you are talking to .
E he . So you can either do what ? Make your language simpler or =
Simpler for him to under- you 'll make him- instead of giving him a hard time to think of what you told him , or to digest what you said , you just give him something simple that will get received .
Mh hhh . And do you think that other students do that for you as well ?
Mhh …
Or- or how-
How I think so because there 's a way that I just- the way people communicate , to me when you are speaking , the- there 's a difference , yes .
There 's a difference ?
Yes .
Mh hhh .
When somebody sees that we ni mtu unaelewa lugha sana , for example , English people tell me that you are good in English . Then I 'll- I 'll know when they meet with him , he 'll use English . He or she will use English in communicating because that 's what language I 'm comfortable in .
And do you feel that you are good in English ? That one I agree . But do you feel that there are some students who are better than you when they speak English ?
Yes .
And do you sometimes find yourself trying to speak like those students ?
Oh yes !
( Interviewer laughs , Ronald joins in ) Why would you want to do that ?
Uhm … Kuna hii kitu kinaitwa- kinaitwa Sheng word for how- how a person speaks =
Just say it .
Ku weng .
Mh hhh . Kuwen . [ Uncertain transcription ]
[ Uncertain transcription ] mtu ana pronounce some words . Kama nikiongea na mtu mwingine halafu English yake ni ile ya kawaida , mi pia ntaongea ile ya kawaida tu =
Utarudi hiyo level =
Ntarudi pia hiyo level =
Oh ! So , it 's not al- it 's not always =
It 's not always kupanda tu ile juu .
Ye- ehe .
Una choose depending on- nikiongea na mtu nasikia English yake iko hivi , mi pia najiweka chini , ndio tukuwe sawa , on the same level . Lakini niki meet na ule mtu yake iko juu hata kushinda yangu =
But why are you ( Ronald laughs ) the one doing this all the time ? Why is it that huyu wa juu asirudi kwa level yako , ama huyo wa chini akuje kwa level yako ya juu ?
Wajua ni ile ya pia unataka kuonyesha w . you = e si mchache [ uncertain transcription ] ( Interviewer laughs ) . You are also somebody =
You are also somebody .
Yeah , who can speak that way .
Mh hhh .
Mh hhh .
Okay , so =
I really do n't know why , but it 's just- it just- it just comes out that way .
So you find yourself =
Si kitu unafikiria , " Sawa . Ache nianze kuongea hivi . " Ukianza tu kuongea na mtu na wapata they have that command of English , you will really try to maintain that standard .
How about- that is English , eh ?
Yes .
Does that also happen for Kiswahili ?
Even for Swahili . Get these guys from Coast . Uwanza kuongea English au- au , I mean wanza kuongea Swahili , very fluent Swahili , bila hata ku mix na Sheng or English or anything else . Pia wewe utaanza kuongea that fluent Swahili sanifu .
Mhh , and does it come out that fluent like them , or is it =
No , no =
artificial ?
It 's si artificial ( Interviewer laughs ) lakini you really struggle .
Ehe . So it 's something you are doing- you do =
Hata mtu atajua tu you are jus struggling
consciously ama you just-
It 's- it 's unconscious .
Unconscious ?
Mhh . Ndio maana unapata mtu anakuambia , " Nimejita naongea kama wewe . "
Mhh . Umejipata tu .
Unasema mtu wa Coast . Umejipata tu unaanza kuongea kama- kama- kama , uh , a guy from Coast .
So you feel that kind of pressure too ?
Yeah , I do n't know why we have to conform to that . I really do n't know why . But we just find ourselves doing it . You do n't decide that , " Now I have to talk this way . " You just find that you are talking that way .
Mhh . But let me- how about for Kipsigis ?
Even Kipsigis =
I- is there differences the way people talk ?
Uhm … Okay , there 's no- not really , uh , notable difference , but you- the- you- you- you can- you can get that difference . Uhm … maybe soon the- the choice of words , the choice of vocabulary . There you 'll find somebody , an older person using certain vocabulary that no- that are no longer used .
That are no longer used ?
Yeah , they 're no longer existant .
That you might even not know the meaning .
Yeah , you 'll have to ask the meaning , " Hii imaanisha nini ? " For example , [ mi nakona bea shida sana ]
But you feel yourself if you are asked that you are fluent in Kipsigis ? Do you feel you are fluent ?
I feel I 'm fluent .
But then you encounter these words =
Yeah , when I encounter hii ndio namuuliza , " Hey ! Hio umetoa wapi ? "
Yeah , " What is that ? "
Yeah . What is that ?
Mhh . E ee , okay . So … huhn . So what you are saying is that people talk the same language , but there are differences in the way , they- they- they =
Yes .
They use the language .
Mhh .
Mh hhh . What do you attribute that to ?
Mhh . May- there 's also the perception maybe that you have towards the person . Kama nimesema , we have two friends wanatoka huko countryside , mwingine anatoka the urban center . So huyu mwingine unamwona ni kama huyu ana- anaelewa hii lugha kushinda , kushinda hii ingine . Na hii ingine , yuko hivi . So , the- the way uta communicate na wewe so ndio italeta that difference .
And , ehe .
And , kuna hii pia , you see someone unaona , " This guy is very bright . " Una- alafu mwingine unamwona anakaa kawa mjinga mjinga hivi kidogo ( smiles a bit , intervier laughs ) . Sa unajaribu hata kumueleza kitu you have to do this thing hivi , hafuati hivo . You try to explain it in maybe even simpler terms .
But hashiki .
But still hashiki . So , then I 'll later that- so the- the-next- the next time you are encounter them , the way you just communicate will be totally different na vile you are communicating with that person who is perceived as bright .
Can you tell from these differences , the way people talk , can you tell where a person comes from , the area that person comes from , from the way they talk ?
Yes .
How- how can you do that ? How can you tell ? This person =
The- the way they pronounce their words .
Mh hhh .
Kalenjins have a problem with P and B , F and V , such that if somebody wanted to say that they are going to … let me use my hometown . They are going to Bomet . They 'll say they are going to Pomet .
Pomet .
Pomet .
That 's it . Sincerely , Bomet . Bomet is a Kipsigis word ? Si ndio ?
Yes .
Why would- why would somebody want to- to- to- call a place something that is difficult for them to pronounce ? Why did n't they just say , " Pomet " ? ( Ronald starts laughing ) . Sasa [ uncertain transcription } start a problem ? Mhh ? What do you- what do you think is caused that ?
Uhm … I think we do n't have the- these uh , the plosive B . We really do n’t have that B . We have- we mainly have =
So the thing is =
the pp ( makes P sound ) . That sound .
So the thing is ,
Yeah ,
whoever wrote Bomet for the first time , was not a Kalenjin .
It 's- yeah , there 's high chances that the guy was not a Kalenjin .
Or also because like you said , there is no written tradition
Yeah .
for … We just came to s- try and write later ,
Yes .
using actually a system that is borrowed ( Mhh ) that is English . So we try to represent sounds the way we hear them , but he says , " Pomet . " Thinking =
Mhh , we get a sound close to that what they said , then we just transcribe .
Mhh . Do you think it- or it 's a-
It 's a " buh " ( makes sounds )
It 's a " buh " ( makes sounds )
Yes .
When- when it come out .
When it comes out .
It 's closer to a " buh . "
It 's closer to a " buh . "
Than a " puh . "
Yes .
Okay . Ehe . So you are telling me that you can tell where a person comes from , so Kalenjins do that .
Kalenjins . We have Kikuyus with the- they have problems with R and L . And somebody will say , uhm , " Kaliuki " instead of , " Kariuki .
Mh hhh . Another issue , then , I also have a- a- [ uncertain transcription ] . We- you have a name , ( laughs ) that letter pronouncing =
( Laughs ) The letter . Yes .
Yeah . That sound [ uncertain transcription ]
I do n't know what they have , because when they have , uh … like-s- for
When it 's an R
When it 's an R , they replace it with an L . When it 's an L , they replace it with an R . So =
So you have noticed that ?
really do n't understand . Why ?! Why ?!
How is that possible =
Why are you forced to- to say , " rrrr " when it 's a " lll . "
Just say what- what is there !
Yes .
Mhh . So it 's something you- you notice with your friends =
Yes .
who are- who are Kikuyu ?
Yeah .
Who are from central province .
And Kambas have a problem with the … adding M and B . Mmm ba .
M and B . Mhh . Mh hhh . ( Laughs )
[ Uncertain transcription ] An explanation to it ?
Mhh . It 's hard to explain .
Yeah , it 's hard to explain . [ Uncertain transcription ]
Because for us Kalenjins , you can say , " mbaret . " You can say-
Yeah , mbaret . You see there 's a mmmbuh ( makes sounds ) .
And it comes out .
And it comes out .
Mhh . Mh hhh .
Mhh , yeah .
Yeah , so you there- can tell =
And also noted there are people who- who replace the buh with a ff , an F . If they say , uh , " Boarding school , " they say , " Foarting school . " ( Interviewer erupts in laughter ) . Yes . I 've heard an instance .
We say not even " poarting , " not boarding .
Not even " poarding . "
They say , " foarding . "
They replace the D with a tt .
Mh hhh .
So it 's a " foarting . "
Foarting .
Foarting school .
Mh hhh .
Hai -- I - I really had a hard time trying to understand =
What they are saying .
what they mean .
And these are Kipsigis people .
These are Kipsigis people .
Mh hhh .
And you find others are not having the same problem , yet they are from the same region , from the same place , but their- their- the problems are not , uh … some problems are just specific to some people .
Mh hhh . So you ca- you are- you can tell that this person is from my area . This person is from home .
Mhh .
From the way they speak .
Yes .
But also you can tell that this person is from another …
Another side of home .
Not a- or not a- okay . Another side of =
Another side of the area .
Another side of the area .
Of that region . Yes .
You can do that ?
Yes .
Aaa ! That 's interesting now because then you 'll- will you be looking at the accent ?
Yeah , there 's an accent and choice of =
Because all of them =
vocabulary .
Choice of vocabulary .
Yes .
Because my- my- my issue was , it seems that you are only using mother tongue interference to tell that this person comes from my place , and this other one comes from Nyanza , this other one comes from Central . Are you just using mother tongue ?
Not really mother tongue interference =
Because all these people =
Choice of vocabulary .
Ehe . For example ?
For example , among the Kalenjins , uh … the- the- the Nandis , they are word for " tomorrow " , let 's say tomorrow in the morning . They say , " mutai . "
Mutai . Ehe .
But for Kalenjins , we say =
For Kipsigis .
Okay , for Kipsigis , we say , " karo . "
Karo .
Ama- ama we just say , " subuhi . " We borrowed the word from Swahili . " Asubuhi , " we say " subuhi . " So- so for Nandis , " karo " means , it just means the next day . But for us it means morning .
Ha- ha- okay . That 's okay . So you can tell that this person is =
So you can tell =
a Nandi =
that this guy is a Nandi
and this person is a Kipsigis .
and this one is a Kipsigis .
How about within Kipsigis ?
Within Kipsigis .
Cause I know you told me that there is Bomet , [ uncertain transcription ] the other side of Sortik , there is Kericho people . Can you tell- can you tell that this person is from- from the way they talk ?
There are guys from Transmara , there is a way they use language that is totally different from =
Transmara , au Kipsigis Trasmara
Transmara Kipsigis , yeah .
because Kipsigis Transmara is- or- mos- or- mostly Maasai .
Yeah , mostly Maasai .
Mhh , but they are Kipsigis .
So I think it 's because of that interaction with the Maasais , that they- they you- you can note some differences in the way they use their language .
So , if like- do you- do you have any =
I do n't have any- the- an example , but there 's just a way that they speak .
That they- mh hhh .
They- you- you- we tend to see them as typical . We call them , " typical Kalenjins . " ( Laughs )
Typical Kipsigis ?
Typical Kipsigis .
A aa !
We have- we have =
So they are even- even with the interference =
Even with interference =
from the Maasai , that 's what- you see them as the typical Kipsigis ?
Ah , people from Chipalungu , we call them typical . We- like- we normally- msh , okay , we normally tease them that we are from the interior part of Bomet . ( Interviewer chuckles ) . Even- the- even if you take them to school , getting rid of that , uh , mother tongue interference , it 's really hard . It 's so hard . But get someone from , uh , let 's say Kericho . Okay , not the interior part of Keri- I 'm using interior to mean those who are frw- those who are far from the urban center . So , the way those people use their language , uh , not- not really using language , but , when you teach them English or Swahili , they 'll tend to have more interferences in- from their mother tongue . Yeah , so , that 's why they [ clean the-] they have some fossilized errors =
Errors .
Errors . They are really hard to get rid of .
E mhh . Mh hhh . How about a Kipsigis from Bomet ,
yes
speaking or talking and another one from , em , Kericho talking . Can you- can you be able to tell the di- and say that this one , " No . This one is from Bomet and this one too . " Is it possible ?
There are only few instances that I 've been able to note the people that u- they use language differently , uhm … in terms of vocabulary only . Not really their accent , but their vocabulary .
So there is a certain vocabulary =
The- there is certain vocabulary
that is common to Kericho people ?
that is common to Kericho people .
Mh hhh .
Yeah , I really can n't think of one right now ,
Yeah , but you can , you can do that .
Yeah , but we- you- you- you can notice .
Mh hhh . How about =
Okay , but that is not very common . It 's hard to detect .
Mh hhh . Let 's move now to the whole country now . Because you told me based on accent , you can tell people come from different regions .
Yes .
How about if it 's not accent , the- the mother tongue interference ? Can you tell that this is a Luo and this is a Kikuyu based on the way they- they s- they talk ?
Based on =
Without any interference .
Base on the way they talk , uh , it will be hard . Yeah , it will be difficult . Yes .
But is it possible ?
It is possible .
Mhh . It is possible to approximate
It is possible .
and say , " This one is likely to be =
Yeah , you- you- you can , believe the-
[ Uncertain transcription ]
I was- there was somebody who- I was- I was asking , uhm , people normally think I 'm a Kikuyu . Maybe because of the way I [ uncertain transcription ]
Appearance .
Appearance .
Oh , so these are [ now ] is appearance .
These are [ uncertain transcription ] appearance .
Not the way you talk ?
Sa somebody told me , uh , I told them I 'm not a Kikuyu . I wanted to [ uncertain transcription ] that I 'm from . And I was- I was speaking in Swahili and yeah , Sheng . So he tried , he tried to listen to the way I was talking , and he said it 's hard to tell where you are from . Because I can n't really notice =
You do n't have the =
any interference from a language .
you were- he was looking for mother tongue interference .
Yeah , he was looking for mother tongue interference .
Mh hhh .
So , I think it 's hard . Without mother tongue interference that would be hard .
Mh hhh . Because when you talked about Kipsigis , those ones from Chipalugu and the others , [ uncertain transcription ] Bomet . You said there 's also choice of words .
Choice of words , yes .
Is there- is there not an instance of choice of words ?
Oh yeah , for- for- for- for this situation , choice of words , yes .
Is there ?
That can identify the person without mother tongue interference , choice of words can do it .
Choice of words .
Choice of words can do it . I can even identify someone from ( starts to laugh ) , someone from the Nyanza region because of their choice of words and also because of their choice of language .
Mh hhh . How do they … choose ?
They normally love talking in English . Like , uh , in [ contact uncertain transcription]this morning . I was talking to him in Sheng and Swahili . And he was responding to me in English .
In English . And sometimes , that- that English that they speak , is it …?
Ha , it 's a polished English . ( Interviewer starts laughing )
It 's a POLISHED English . ( Still laughing ) .
Yes .
So they choose some words that are …
They really choose- they really choose some … really big words [ uncertain transcription ] .
Vocabularies that =
Vocabulary , their vocabulary is really good .
that we are not in everyday use .
No , they 're not in everyday use .
So , a Kikuyu speaking English …
Is different from a Luo speaking English .
And a Kalenjin speaking English .
And a Kalenjin speaking English .
It 's also different .
Different .
Mhh .
UNLESS , bo- uh , if the- if the- if a Kalenjin Luo and a Kikuyu have both been- all of them have been brought up in the same environment . That 's when they can- maybe they can speak the same way .
Mh hhh . Do you not =
But now because- because- they- they are in different environments , different environments call for different vocabulary . So there are some certain vocabulary in- which will be used more commonly , maybe in Nyanza .
So it 's more regional , not about individuals .
So it 's about regions , not individuals .
Because if the individuals are put together in a neutral region , then they 'll not- you 'll not notice differences .
Yeah , you will not notice .
So it 's the region that influences .
It 's the reason that influences the choice of vocabulary .
Mhh hee .
Like in Kalenjin , there are some things that we do n't have there . If you start talking about lime stone and other kinds of minerals , there are not found in the- in this side of Salt Rift .
So people will not talk about them .
Yes . But you go to Nyanza , and you start talking about the hyacinth and uh …
Fish .
Fish . Different kinds of fish . You go to Coast , there are different kinds of fish there , and you find the corral reefs . So , it all depends on the region … and the type of vocabulary they [ uncertain transcription ]
So that is English .
There 's English .
Kiswahili ?
Even Kiswahili , there =
It 's the same .
It 's the same thing .
So it 's possible the way somebody speaks their Kiswahili , you can approximate and say , " He , from that choice of words , he 's an- ni -ni - he 's a Kalenjin . "
He 's a Kalenjin . You 'll hear them talking more of things to do with , uh , animals , things to do with cultivation of farms . But get someone from Nyanza , talking about fishing .
Things that identify with in everyday [ uncertain transcription ]
Things that identify la- region .
Mhh . So we are saying that it is possible from listening to somebody talk , it 's possible to say , this person comes from a certain place .
A certain place .
That one we agree .
Yes .
How about if you cannot see this person ? You just hear them speak , but you cannot see them . Okay ? Like radio , tuseme , somebody is talking on radio . Or somebody is in the corridor there talking . Can you say , " Ah , that was a Luo that went , that- that- that just talked their way . " Is it possible to do that ?
With- with that uh- with that accent , if they- if there 's that interference with mother tongue , I 'll know .
But , a choice of words ,
There 's- there 's-
does that apply now when you do n't see them ?
Uh , if- if they speak for a considerable length of time , that 's now when you can start identifying = features .
You can start identifying features of .
But if it 's only a one minute talk .
Let 's say it 's a radio program of two hours .
Of two hours ?
Mhh .
Okay . Uhm … yeah , you can , but maybe you 'll- you might also miss out .
You might also miss out .
You might also miss out .
But there is a chance that =
It 's difficult . There 's a chance that you- might- you might have a guess . But it 's not really one hundred percent .
But if there 's mother tongue interference , then very easy , even if you can n't see them .
Very easy . The intonation . For example Luos . They have some kind of intonation , you can tell that , that 's just a Luo . Kisis , they have some really high notes .
And na Kipsigis ?
Kipsigis they are kind of uh- we are told we 'd speak with some slower- slower pace .
You-you- mnavuta maneno .
Kuvuta maneno . ( Laughs . Interviewer joins in . )
Mh hhh .
Then Nandis wana rap kabisa .
Fast !
Very , very fast .
Have you heard Nandis talk ?
Yes .
And you find …?
There 's a guy who 's- a- he 's- uh ... we stayed together in ho- hostel . Lakini anakaa opposite my- my room . Akikuja kwangu , uh , maybe anaomba hata some- something tu . Namwambia , " Hey ! Wait first . Tell it to me in English . "
( Erupts in laughter )
This or slower please !
Or slow- eh- because you know the words , but they are very fast .
It just gets , " something , rrrrrrr stop . " ( Both Ronald and interviewer laugh ) " Eeeee karide . " " Eeeee sabuni " ( They both laugh . ) So you are like , " What ?! Umesema nini ? "
Mhh . Ah , okay . So , it 's possible .
Yeah , for example , for- for Kipsigis , the word uh , " Please help me with your- " let 's say your [ iron books ] . Kipsigis say , " Toreton pasi . " Toreton . You get that to-re-ton . That 's- that 's the- the syllable .
Mh hhh . Toreton .
Then for- for Nandis , they say , " To'to . " ( Both interviewer and Ronald laugh . ) To'to . To'to .
To'to .
To'to . Where as is toreton .
So it takes you time to to say what ?
Toreton . So theirs ' " Torto . " What ? " Torto . " ( Both laugh . ) They 'll even get it [ unclear transcription ]
It 's even pushing or something .
And they are like , torto is- is more of uh … it- it sounds like , uhm … " torten , " which is " push . "
Yeah , now just [ unclear transcription ] . Yeah , that 's what I was thinking .
Torto , toto . So you 'll be mixed up , like , what are you saying ?
Yeah , it sounds like something else .
Mhh .
Mh hhh . So it 's possible to identify these things based on background [ unclear transcription ] person .
Ee .
How about things like somebody 's level of education ? Can you- can you be able to tell =
Yes .
somebody 's level of education =
Yes .
from the way they talk ?
Yes .
Mh hhh . How =
Choice of vocabulary too .
Choice of vocabulary .
Mainly- most of these : basically choice of vocabulary , pronounciation . Though there are some people whose level of education , they are even up to PhD level , but they still have interference from mother tongue . But try to get the vocabulary they are using ,
It is a higher level .
Yeah , it is of a higher level .
So a PhD person …
So a PhD person will use language totally different
from somebody who dropped out in primary school .
who dropped out , yeah , who dropped out in primary school .
Mhh .
Yes .
And so it 's possible .
Yeah , it 's really possible . Somebody will tell you , " Wow , you have really good English . "
Mh hhh . And eh , speak like , somebody 's position in the society . Can you be able to tell that this person is big man somewhere , and this man , " Ai ! " Huyu ako tu .
Normally there- those guys who have positions , they use official language .
Yeah , so you can tell from the way they talk .
So you can tell . If somebody came , if you are with- if you are just chatting with friends ,
Yeah ( yawns )
then somebody ,
But look at =
somebody , a stranger just comes and talks to us in English , you 'll just start looking at him and say this guy he must be some- some- some official somewhere . They are somebody in position .
But look at our former president . When he talks Kiswahili . ( They both smile and laugh . ) Is it official Kiswahili when he 's talking ?
His Swahili is poor . ( Interviewer laughs heartily ) . Even his choice of words , he was totally out . He really had a poor command of Swahili .
So if he 's- he talks Kiswahili , was it possible to tell that this person is a president and- and somebody else in the village ?
Now- now- now those are the exceptions . ( They both laugh . )
But when he used English ?
When he used English , mhh …
Then you can almost say it sounds =
Apart from the English that he was reading , the- the written text that he was given , his English was also not really that good . I do n't know if the accident effected him .
Yeah , maybe .
But he used to have that uh … to be hesitant in speech .
We have political parties in Kenya . Is it possible to be from- yeah , just still looking at that issue of the way somebody talks . Can you tell that this person is from one political party and the other one is the other political party from the way they talk ?
Mhh …
Somebody talks to you . You are like , this must be … the grade party , and this must be the green party . Is it- is it possible ?
May- you can- you can get that from what you are talking about . If the person is talking to you about the Jubilee Manifesto and how the government is really doing good work in achieving that , uh , maybe working towards Vision 2030 . Maybe it 's- he 's supporting the project of buying our laptops for children doing classwork .
Then you know this person is …
From- from the- from what you are talking about , you can know this person is someone who- who is aligned to Jubilee . But if the person is opposing those , uh , those issues , you 'll know this- this- this is from the opposition . The =
What if it 's a neutral topic ? Not- we are not discussing a manifesto of a party .
Ee okay .
We are just discussing an issue like … What now ? Do [ uncertain transcription ] deserve higher pay ?
Mhh … wou , that is really hard …
Mh hhh .
I 've never really had that encounter .
So usually , you can- you can tell , if there is something that is- that they can- they want to defend or they want to support , based on the policies =
Based on the policies . Maybe what they are supporting or what they are opposing =
So even without them saying directly that I am from this party , from the way they are using language and the way they are , they are supporting some issues , then you can say , " This one must be this side . "
Yes .
Mhh . And this one , that side .
That- that is- that is the way I ca- I can judge .
Ee okay .
But based on if it 's a neutral topic , I think it will really be difficult .
Difficult .
Ah .
Okay . Uhm … earlier , earlier you told me that you speak different languages to different people . When do you do this ? Let 's start with English for example . Which people ?
English ?
Mh hhh . Where ?
Just- when I just walk into an office , for example in this School of Arts , I just walk into an office , the language that just comes into mind , I do n't s- I do n't now tell myself , " Now you have to use English . " It 's just automatic . It 's something subconscious . It just- just comes out that way . But when I =
So in an office .
So in an office .
How about people- how about people , what kind of people ?
If I meet somebody older than me , uh …
Older than you ? In the village ?
Older than me . Older than me , I mean , uhh ... not- not- not in the village . Here in school , and even- judging from the way the person is dressed , I 'll know what language to use . If it 's somebody older than me , but is- is working , maybe , uh ... as a cleaner , I 'll use Swahili . Because from- I 'll just judge because this person is a cleaner , their level of education must be to a certain level which , uh , he or she is more comfortable with language of their level , which is Swahili . Bu-n- then- then , I 'll for- for somebody who is working maybe in administration , I 'll use English because I just assume their- because they are- simply by working here , I assume you- you know this English language very well . Yeah , so ... really , really-
Kipsigis ?
Kipsigis ?
Which people are these ? You talked about your family ?
Mhh . When I 'm- when I ’m at home [ back there ] , if it 's a [ uncertain transcription ] I do n't know , I 'll use Swahili .
Even around home area ?
Around home area . Unless they start talking to me in Kipsigis , is when I 'll respond back in Kipsigis . But if I 'm the one who is to approach them , I 'll use Swahili . Because nowadays , we- we have people from different tribes coming together . But also it depends on the region that I 'm in . If it 's in the- in the- in the more urban side , I 'll use that English or Swahili . But if I go to the rural area there , I 'll just assume the- all these people know or are speaking Kipsigis .
Now =
For peers , for my peers , it 's also depends . If this person , the level of education . I 'll know they 've gone up to university level , or even high school level .
There is a =
I 'll use Sheng , or Kiswahili . But if the person dropped out of chuas three , class five =
You also talked about Sheng being…there 's that Sheng from Nairobi and there is other Sheng .
Yeah .
So you 'll also rate that this one =
( Smiles ) I 'll also rate that this one will not understand this Sheng from Nairobi . Yes .
O , okay .
For example , there- there is- there is- there is a … [v -- lt kind of Sheng ] , eh- eh- for … referring to money . For example , uh , five hundred shillings , people refer to as " punch . " Then , normally , it is sotano .
Which is [ still ] Sheng .
Which is [ still ] Sheng .
Mhh . But that is [ uncertain transcription ] .
But for someone in the village , I tell them , " punch , " they 'll not really understand because punch means something else .
Yeah .
Then there 's two hundred shillings . Rwabe . There 's the- the- the Sheng that is trending now . But- they- they- they know sombili . So there somoja for a hundred , sombili , sotatu , three hundred . So , I 'll use- I 'll use the different- the different kind of Sheng for different people .
Wow . You already told me that you- sometimes that you have tried to change the way you talk .
Yes .
Mhh ? Based on- sometimes you want to weng , what you are coding weng , and sometimes you want … Is that true ?
It is true .
So … what circumstance- just-just tell me again [ uncertain transcription ] brief .
If I meet somebody who is speaking that English like , like a mzungu from the US , I 'll also try to speak like them . Okay , not really trying to speak like them , but I just find myself doing that . It just comes subconsciously . So , I think it is something like , we are trying to ... bring yourself to their level because you perceive them as ... for higher level . Just a perception .
You are saying that this think can go either up or down .
It can go up or down .
Or is it mostly up ?
Mostly , it is up . You 'll not try to lower yourself .
[ Uncertain transcription ]
Yeah , you will try to lower yourself to … but situations can- can demand that you do that . Normally for face-saving . You 'll not want to embarrass someone , or try to make them , ah …, think…you 'll not want to make them think little of themselves .
So I know you are busy now with exams are coming up . The topics on everybody 's lips now is exam and cuts . If you [ uncertain transcription ] the cut , if you handed in the assignment . Is that something you are talking about a lot ?
Yeah , that 's what we talk about a lot .
But any other time apart from exam time , when you are just relaxing in your hostels , what topics do you usually discuss ?
Yeah , I agree that now we- we are facing these exams , projects and assignments , classes … Ah =
That is what you are talking about so much now .
So much now . But =
Any other topics when you are relaxing ?
When you are- when you are =
Cause I know you will relax .
Yeah , we will do . And normally , the … the guys , talk different , different issues or topics ,
Mh hhh . For example-
from the chicks .
For example ?
So for the guys , normally we talk about , uh , we talk about money , we talk about ladies , and we talk about our- just our future lives . What it will be like , what car you 'll buy .
Money , ladies , future life .
Yes .
Why these three topics ?
I think we =
Why not =
we just find ourselves so comfortable =
Why not something about the [ uncertain transcription ] discussing , eh ? Mhh ?
Yeah , so , now- now- that- now that is what is I ’m coming to next .
Yeah .
So , it depends on the people you are with . What kind of people are you with ? If there are friends who are used to that kind of lifestyle , who 'd be drinking and women .
So you 'll even talk about , yesterday I was at [ unclear transcription] =
You 'll not- you 'll not introduce- yeah , you will not introduce a topic that there 'll- that there are not interested in . You will not start talking about how maybe Jesus Christ did this in the bible . Nobody will be interested .
They 'll switch off . ( Starts to chuckle )
They 'll just tell you off .
Yeah .
" What are you talking about ? " But start talking about some- something that they are interested in , they 'll have a LOT to talk about . But now go to someone whose interest is maybe in , uhm , things to do with uh ...
Church .
Yeah , church .
Mh hhh . CU members and so .
CU members . And you start introducing topics that they are very uncomfor- uncomfortable with . They- they 'll not even want to speak to you . So it depends on the likes and dislikes of a person .
So you told me that men discuss money ,
Money .
Chicks ,
Chicks .
And their- their future lives . The ladies ?
The ladies are al =
Yeah , ladies first .
Ok- well- okay , the ladies , I 've heard the ladies . They also do speak about relationships , how they want to be treated , what they want their future to be . They fantasize about their wedding ; how they are going to have kids ; what kind of husband ; how they are going to treat their husbands . So , things to do with , ah , sentimentals . Things that have sentimental values .
Emotion and so on .
Things with emotions .
Yeah . How about when it 's a lady now and a man talking ?
When it 's a lady and a man talking ?
Yeah . What are they talking about ?
Uhm … Mhh … Let me see now what we normally talk about . ( Laughs a little ) . Yeah , we do speak about relationships .
Mh hhh . This relationship seems to be a hot topic .
( Laughs ) Yeah- it 's b- we- we- we are now being prepared to- to go out there and =
Mhh , and start [ uncertain transcription ] and so on .
then after getting a job , yeah , you 'll start thinking of starting a family .
Yeah .
Yeah , we do talk about relationships , we talk about our jobs , how to the- how you are going to start searching for jobs . We also talk about people . How you talk about your friends ? You know ladies like talking about people . Gossiping , if I may say . They 'll- they 'll- and they like being listened to . They do much of the talking . And the guys do more of listening .
More of listening .
So they tell you about a friend of theirs who did this ; who wronged them ; they used their make-up this way ; they took one of their shoes ; they took- I mean it 's issues to do with them , and they want somebody who can listen .
What are your plans after you finish ?
Uuh , after I finish here ?
Ehn . What do you =
First of all , uhm , I 'm really interested in business .
Business .
( Laughs )
A aa ! You are a …
I 'm an entrepreneur .
Yeah . Have you tried business before ?
Yeah , when I joined first year , there was uh … this strike in 2009 . We went home for a month . And before we went home , there 's a guy I 'd met here in school . He was designing cards .
Cards ?
Birthday cards . And uh … yeah , I love cards . So , I also went home . I did n't really have anything to do , so , there was a time I went to Nairobi , that 's before the- the- before we came back . It was- it was the success card time . The- the form fours and class eights were sitting the exams . So , I also traveled to Nairobi , went to River Road , and then I bought some materials , which I came and I designed some cards .
Mh hhh . Designed some cards . You are good in [ uncertain transcription ]
I had no idea what I- what I was even- I wasn- buying things I did n't have an idea what they are for .
You had never done =
I 'd never done =
anything like that before .
But because of the ... creative nature that I have , I just came up with something . And on the first day I sold cards worth eight hundred shillings .
Mh hhh ! Wow ! How much was one ?
I was just amazed . A hundred shillings .
A hundred shillings .
It amazed me !
Where did you sell them ? You are =
Just at home , Bomet .
E he . Around , you just take them to people .
Yeah , you take them to people . And the- the people I took them to- because I customize them . I printed somebody 's name and I even put their photo their . So that is- it was a new product .
Yeah . It was something new too , ' cause I 've never seen that . Yuh huhn .
It was something new . Yes . So , uhm , I- I-I- I 've developed the skills , I now design even … I design some- var- various things on the computer , though I have n't had any formal training .
So , you are doing that now as
[____ design ]
you are studying and doing that par t-t ime ?
Yes .
Mh hhh . How is the success so far ?
Yeah . I- I would- I- I- [ uncertain transcription ]
You 've been doing well ?
Yeah . I have- I have the skills now . Sometimes I do n't even do it for the money .
Ohh , yeah .
I- I- somebody comes with a problem , maybe they want uh … to design a logo . I just tell them , " Tell me what you need in this logo . " I try to visualize for them what they want . And I design = I design for them and I call them , they approve it =
Usually in the newspaper , there are these logo competitions .
Yes .
Have you tried them even [ uncertain transcription] =
I do n't know why I 've never tried any of those .
You need to try . Yeah . Yeah , so the first thing you 'll go and do is to try and open some place ?
Yeah , open a design business .
Ehe . In Bomet or …?
There 's- there 's- there 's no design in Bomet . Even =
Or Keri- evenKericho .
Kericho the- Kericho the- the ones that are there , they outsource . They have the office , yes .
But they send things to Nairobi …
But they send things to Nairobi to be printed
So why do n't you try- Kericho is a bigger market .
Yeah , it 's a bigger market . I 'll- I 'll just- this thing of starting small because of capital . Yeah , so , the- there are- there are numerous [ uncertain transcription ] in design . For example , there 's these uhm … designing uhm … labels for companies . Even printing on mugs , t-shirts , umbrellas ; these promotional items . That 's what I really want to do .
A aa . All the best . I wish you all the best , huh ? Thank you for your time .
You are welcome . Thank you .
