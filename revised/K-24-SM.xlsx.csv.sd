come . On today 's uhh , discussion .
Thank you .
Yea , we shall just discuss on language and language use . The way we use language with friends ,
Okay .
in our families ,
Yes .
and all that .
Okay .
So , maybe to start with , I 'd like to ask you : which kind of language do you use when you are with your family ?
With my family , I use my native language , which is Kikuyu . Because , it 's uh- in a my family setting , you do n't necessarily speak English or any other language to your family members . You just use the language they taught you when you were born . They taught me Kikuyu , so I speak Kikuyu to my granothers , my mother . But there are those other family members who are educated who are my age mates or at least they 've gone to school , those ones we can speak with in ki-ehh inEnglish , in Kiswahili na wakati mwingine Sheng pia .
Mm hh . Kwa kava umetaja lugha kama tatu hivi .
Naam .
Lakini haswaa , mkiwa na familia ?
Ni Ki-zz- Ni Kikuyu .
Ni Kikuyu ?
Ndio .
Na kwa sababu gani ?
Kwa sababu , ukiwazungumzia ki-Kiingereza wataona ni kama hutaki waelewe maneno mengine .
Mm hh .
It ' s like you are talking to yourself .
Mm hh .
So , instead of locking them out , just use a language that they are going to understand -
Mm hh .
all of them , so that you can include everybody-
ah
from the youngest to the oldest .
Mm hh .
Yes .
Yea . Mm . Now when you are with friends , which kind of language do you use ?
Ah mabeshdi na tumia Sheng , Kizungu , Kiswahili . Lakini pia ina depend nao mabeshdi ya akina nani .
Mm hh .
Kuna wale ambao ni professional friends . Hao unatumia lugha ambayo wako kuwa professional . Kama ni wa kizungu : use English .
Mm hh .
Kama wa Kiswahili , Kiswahili . But ALL my other friends , we mix up languages -
Mm hh .
including Kikuyu .
Okay .
Yes , I remember this instance where , especially in the morning , today in the morning-
Naam .
with my roomate-
Mh hh
just woke up and he 'd- I asked him , " What do , what do you say in your language , how do you greet each other in your language ? "
Mh hh .
And he told me you say , " Mulembe . " That is Luhya for " How are you ? "
Mh hh .
And I was as well , I replied , " Mulembe . "
Okay .
Tell him I 'm also well .
Okay .
Yes .
So , talking of that , that was a friend in school .
Yes .
Now , we also want to talk about the language that you use in school ? Which language do you use mostly in school ?
There in school , we use English because it is a language the that is used to give us instructions by teacher us , we grade exams in English , apart from if their language , different languages . So every other language that 's used here is English .
Mh hh .
But , mabeshdi , my friends , we use any other language that we can find , IF it 's not in class .
Mh hh .
Outside the classroom we can use any other language as well .
Mh hh . Na -
Ndio .
Na ni vizuri umetaja Kiingereza .
Naam .
Nadhani na kwamba ni muhimu kujifunza Kiingerereza kwa vyevyote vile . Na ni kwanini ?
Nafikiri ni muhimu kila mtu ajuwe Kiingereza . Maanake , mahali tumefika , kwanza kabisa hapa Kenya , English is an official language .
Naam .
So if you do n't know an official language , how would you move on with the society ? How would you cooperate ? How would you interact with the society ? Plus , I think English is a global language and to me it sounds prestigious .
Yea .
And if so many people in the world speak English , I think it is important for those people who are young or those who are growing up as well to know English .
Mh hh .
Nafikiri ni muhimu .
Okay . What is your experience with English as compared to other languages ?
My experience with English , nikizungumza Kizungu unaonekana kama uko , uko juu kidogo .
Naam .
Ni kama umesoma kwa sababu that is the language that is used to teach us .
Mh hh .
So ukizungumza Kizungu , unaonekana umesoma .
Mh hh .
Eeh yaani you are knowledgable .
Mh yea .
Ukizungumza Kikuyu , unaonekana , ni kama haujasoma , ama kuna watu ambao unakaa kaa kufungia nje . Hutaki wasiwa unasema nini .
Naam .
Kwa hivyo ili kuleta watu wengi ambao mko pamoja ambo wanazungumza lugha tofauti- eeh , muwe pamoja ,
Mh hh .
utabidi tu uzungumzie Kizungu .
Mh hh .
Kwa sababu , for instance , darasa letu , that is our class ,
Mh hh ,
I can n't use my native language because na different , eh backgrounds of , eh , different linguistic backgrounds .
Yea .
So we have to use a language that will combine each one of us ,
Mh hh .
that will bring us together , that is English .
Okay .
Ni vigumu sana unipate nikizungumza Kikuyu kwa kabisa .
Kuna instance ambayo Kiingereza imekuweka ,
Naam .
katika hali nyingine ,
Naam .
na ilikuwa ni situation gani ?
A aah .
Mhh .
Back in the village , eh ?
Mh hh .
kuna pale tunakutana youth .
Yea .
Sasa , tukikutana pale youth , utaona kila mtu anajaribu ku- , kuji- kuzungumza . Hata kama mnazungumza Kikuyu ,
Yea .
ataweka jina la Kizungu pale , hapa na pale
Naam .
kuonyesha at least , mimi pia ninaelewa hii , eh ? Niko updated ,
Mh hh .
nimesoma kidogo .
Mh hh .
So hata mimi , ingawa nikienda pale , I do n't have to use , the- you know- uhh difficult English .
Mh hh .
I use simple language , simple English , which at least they can understand . I think tunaweza ita hii local language .
Yea .
Ya kizungu . Si ile nimesoma tunakimia vocabularies kubwa
Mhh .
natumia tu kidogo at least kuwaonyesha hata mimi nimesoma , lakini sitaki msikie vibaya sana .
Naam .
So if , kwa immediately ukizungumza Kizungu , in my village we speak English , then you show that you are learned , at least , ahead of the others .
Okay .
Ndio .
And people respect you for that ?
People respect you because unajua kaa kuna meeting series inafanyika
By the minimum meetings mingi niende nikaandike minutes because I understand English . Na wanataka hizo minutes ziwekwe in English .
Mh hh .
So they call upon me , " Come and be our secretary . "
Okay .
Sometimes they are security meeting , lakini mi ndio ninaandika minutes .
Yea .
Yes . That is ah -what they treasure English .
Okay .
Mhh .
Now you say that you understand Kikuyu as your native language ,
Yes , very well .
Wadhani kwamba native language ni muhimu ?
Native language ni muhimu kwa mtoto mdogo
Naam .
because they way you understand your native language helps you to understand other languages .
Okay .
Nimeona watu wanamatatizo ya kuelewa lugha zingine kama hawaelewi native langauge yao .
Okay . Mh hh
Yes .
Kuna wale watu ambao wanaongea lugha halisi ,
Naam .
hata kama ni lugha mama .
Naam .
kuna wale ambao wakiongea hivi wanatumia mafumbo mengine ambao huwezi kuyaelewa .
Mh hh .
Na ni lugha , lugha -
ya mama
ni ya mama
Nakuelewa .
Wewe umepata changamoto ya kwamba pengine huwezi kuelewa mafumbo haya .
Definitely -
Ah ha ?
there are challenges when it comes to - you know there are those people who are , you know , we can - , in Kiswahili tunawaita " Wazao wa lugha . " You know like the , the custodians of the language .
Okay .
The older generation .
Yea .
Sometimes they speak in phrases that you do n't understand ,
Mh hh .
because it is the same language that you are speaking , you are speaking Kikuyu
Okay .
But they will use phrases that they want to lock you out , and you would n't understand unless they explain to you . I remember my granother is fond of using proverbs in Kikuyu .
Yea .
For example , he would tell me , that eeh , now that I come here and work hard , whether I have fees or not , she tells me , " Mwanamuge , dalagha mudhabia . " No , not , mwanamughe , it 's " Mwanawekeo , daghadha mudhabia . "
Okay .
Which means that a hard working kid always has a person to support him or her .
Okay .
So he will , she will tell me , " Just go and work hard . Even if there are no fees , do n't worry . You will find some fees somehow . "
Mh hh .
Yes .
What is your opinion about how much we should know about our native language ? Do we just know our native language ' cause we want to communicate with some other people or we still need to have these proverbs ?
I think , you know , once you understand a language , you should understand eeh , the whole of it .
Mh hhh .
Use proverbs , phrases . For you to be told that you can communicate effectively in a certain language , these are areas that you can n't avoid .
Mh hhh .
So , do n't just scratch the surface in your language and say you know Kikuyu or that you know your native language . I also understand some proverbs , and I also speak to my granother in those proverbs , and we understand each other . So it is important to know deeper , go deeper into the language because even English has got its own proverbs , has its own phrases that can be used .
You told me earlier that you are indeed a .
Yes .
Have you ever found difficulties in reading a Kikuyu bible ?
Personally ? No , because as I grew up , I was eeh , we used to have a bible . It was already translated into Kikuyu .
Mh hhh .
And we were taught , ehh , memory verses in Kikuyu . And I 'm going to recite Luke 2:52 . It says in Kikuyu , " Luka igere , mhe-mhari wamiro gweta na nona igere . Na keji sogi kura akanene khagha , akieda bone ghai onado . " Which means , eeh , " It 's Luke 2:52 and Jesus grew you [ uncertain transcription ] increased in age having favor with the Lord . Amen . " Yes .
That 's great .
Thank you .
So , I have you found other people who cannot do like you do ?
Yes , there are people who can n't read , eeh , can n't read Kikuyu by book as fluently as they do to English .
Yea .
And sometimes they forgo the Kikuyu bible . It 's like they do n't want to do anything with it , they just want to read English version .
Wow ! That ' s interesting . And you think reading an English version will be easier than reading your own native language ?
For them , it is . But for me , I think , it is , yes it is , you know , you know , English is simpler than my native language I would say . ( He he )
( Okay )
( He he )
Now , now , so far we 've talked about three languages .
Yes .
Kikuyu , oh Kiswahili , English
Yes
Umejipata ya kwamba una mix these languages ,
kabisa
kwa conversation moja tu ,
kabisa
Naam .
Najipata tu asubuhi naamka , nasema , " Ah moli iko anatya . " That is : how is today ? "
Yea .
And then I , my [ uncertain transcription ] I just greet my- the person that is next to me , " How are you ? How did you sleep ? "
Mh hh .
" Ulilalaje ? " " Leo unataka tukunywe chai ama tukunywe kahawa ? "
Mh hhh .
Na , " Do have a class today ? " Like you know , it 's the same conversation , but I 've asked three different questions in three different languages .
Okay .
Yes .
So mostly in which situations and maybe for what reasons do people mix languages ? And in your opinion , what can you say is the reason ?
Ahh , I think , kuna pahali ukitumia lugha tofauti nyingi ,
Mh hhh .
unaonekana ni kama eh , unaelewa sana , you know a lot .
Okay .
And people wo n't have an impression that , " yes , I do know . " So tukipatana na mabeshdi , I want to show them that I know English , I want , I want to show them I know Kiswahili , I know Kikuyu as well . But the other instances that you cannot use Kikuyu , you cannot use a single language alone . For example , nimeenda kwa market .
Mh hhh .
Hapa tu kwa mamboga .
Mh hhh .
I just want to buy vegetables .
Mh hhh .
That mamboga is a , is from different community . As for my , so itabidi - and she does not understand English . Itabidi nimezungumza ama nime mix , Kizungu , Kiswahili , hizo mbili sana sana . Sitatumia yangu .
Mh hhh .
Unless ni- it 's a common name between us .
Mh hhh .
E ee .
Kwava wewe aghalabu uchanganya lugha vipi ?
Bila shaka mi mchanga lugha maanake nazielewa zote tatu .
Mh hhh .
Naam .
Zote tatu ?
E ee . Kizungu , Kiswahili na Kikuyu .
Lakini mara nyingi ?
Mara nyingi uchanganya Kizungu na Kiswahili .
Naam .
Naam .
Okay . In the way you speak ,
Yes .
have you noticed any difference from the others , other students talk ?
It depends in the language . There 's a language that I 'm not very good in , for example , French .
Mh hhh .
So , there 's definitely there 's a difference between they way I speak , because I speak slowly , I want to be cautious , is it the right word or not ?
Mh hhh .
But the others know they speak well .
Mh hhh .
When it comes to Kiswahili , nazungumza vizuri sana .
Mh hhh .
Tena kwa haraka na sichanganyi Kiswahili na- unajuwa kuna Kiswahili kile halisi na Kiswahili ambacho siyo halisi vile .
Naam .
Ni Kiswahili ambacho kimeswahidishwa maneno ya Kizungu yamewekwa tu kwa lugha ya Kiswahili .
Mh hhh .
Kwa hivyo Kiswahili nazungumza vizuri , Kifaransa sizungumzi vizuri . Vile vile , kunawatu- kunatofauti kati ya mimi na wengine .
Mh hhh .
Naam .
Iwapo ungesikiza mtu akiongea ,
Mh hhh .
hujamwona huyu jamaa .
Naam .
Lakini waweza tambua ya kwamba huyu jamaa iwatoka mahali fulani ?
Bila shaka ,
Haswaa ? Pale kwe ?
Bila shaka .
Mh hhh .
Kwa sababu kuna differences in pronounciation .
Mhh naam .
Maana hapo unashachanganya tayari . Umesha hamisha . Kuna tofauti ,
Mh hhh .
ya pronounciation ya maneno .
Yea .
Kuna vile wana tamka yao , kuna vile tunatamka yetu .
Mh hhh .
So for example , I think , ehh , let me give you an example of aaa , of a , of a what ? Of a chart . You know the chart that you draw things .
Mh hhh .
There 's a , some place in my region , where they do n't call it " chart " . They call it , " shirt , " as in the one that we wear . So they confuse the two sounds ; ch and sh .
Mhh .
So they confuse the two sounds ; ch and sh .
Okay .
So if I hear somebody speak and say , " Ah , that is from my community . "
Mh hhh .
Because , at least , he or she is saying it correctly .
Mh hhh .
But if he she eeh , sorry , if he said it wrongly ,
Mh hhh .
I would know that it is from this particular region .
Mh hhh .
Yes .
And so you , you can easily tell from the kind of sounds they-
Yes .
they use .
Yes .
Or they confuse , rather .
Yes .
Okay . In the same way , if you ever heard somebody , aah talking , without seeing these people , could you tell maybe the , the kind of background they have had before ? Maybe their level of education , the status that they have in the society , and maybe their political affiliations ? Can you tell ?
Ah , to start with the political affiliation , maybe unaweza sema kwa sababu utasikie ile upande anatetea . Here in Kenya , tunazoea sana kutetea upande wetu .
Naam .
We are alm- wa are always , you know , fighting for our side . And we are against the other side .
Mhh .
So if you listen to a person speak for example a particular , you know , talking about Party A , you will know whether he belongs to Party A or Party B by just listening .
Mhh .
You will tell .
Okay .
Unless that person is a political analyst who is neutral . But you can tell people who are from different political camps . Halafu , about background ya mtu , yes , you can tell . Because ile background mimi nimekuwa nayo , ina relate na hali nimetoka .
Yea .
Kwa hivyo , the way I see things , is the way I have been ? I have been brought up of from where I come from .
Yea .
There are things that I 'm going to say you will not understand because you do n't come from my background . There are things that I 'm , that I will say , because we , you know , at least we are from the same region you know , unasikia huyo mtu - you can relate to what the person is talking about .
Mh hhh .
So you know this kind of a person could have this kind of a ? A background .
Mh hhh .
Eh ndio . Unaweza tell kutokana na vile mtu anaongea .
Na status ?
Status ni ngumu .
Mh hhh .
Kusikia tu mtu akizungumza ni ngumu . Usikie useme huu mtu pengine ni , mm he 's rich . But you can also tell because there are things they will say and you have either not , eh , met them , or you have , you know , you have interacted with them . For example , nakumbuka mi upenda sana ni kusoma gazeti . Na nikisoma gazeti , kuna zile vitu naona wameandika pale , ati sijui you should have- For example kuna hii article walikuwa wanasema pahali tuseme unataka kumpeleka msichana date . You want to take your girlfriend out on a date . There are ages ? [uncertain transcription ] that they are going to give you and you know that ili ages[uncedrtain transcription ] they are only affordable by rich people .
Mhh
So you ask yourself : Did the person or who was writing here or was he targeting me ? Or was he targeting this group of people , this class of people ?
Mhh
So you can tell by the vocabulary they use , maybe wanazungumza kuhusu going to the gym . Poor people do n't go to the gym .
Mhh .
Its only rich people who go to the gym .
Okay .
He 's talking about driving a , a four-wheel drive , and they are saying it 's not sufficient for their use . Poor people do n't even drive a car , but you see the person talking of high things . So you can tell the- yes , you can the status of a person by the way they speak .
Mh hhh .
By what they , by the language they use .
Mh hhh .
Ndio .
Okay . Do you diff- speak eh different languages to different people ?
Of course .
Mh hhh .
Aah , to my seniors who are , you know , who are I pr- my , in my profession , I speak English or Kiswahili . To my seniors , eh , they are not in my profession , we can speak Kikuyu , English or Kiswahili depending on the situation .
Mh hhh .
If it is formal , use formal language : Kiswahili or English . If it 's informal , it 's a mixture .
Mh hhh .
Ndio .
Kwa nini , kwa nini watumia lugha tofauti kwa watu tofauti pengine ?
Ndio nilete ule ? Ule mtangusano [ uncertain transcription ] ni wavute karibu na mimi .
Mh hhh .
Sitaki wasikie ama ni waweke juu sana na mimi niko chini , ama niko juu na wako chini .
Mh hhh .
Sitaki wasikie hivyo . Nataka tuwe pamoja ,
Mhh
tuwe karibu , ili tukizungumza tunaelewana kabisa .
Mh hhh .
Ndio .
Kwamba tuseme ni situations gani sasa waweza tumia lugha tofauti kwa watu tofauti ?
Kuna huu wakati beidhetu [ uncertain transcription ] tulikuwa tumeenda kwa daktari .
Naam .
Nilikuwa mimi , na my grandmother na now the doctor .
Yea .
My grandmother anajua Kikuyu tu na Kiswahili .
Yea .
The doctor anaelewa Kizungu peke yake .
Mh hhh .
So I had to come in and you know , now speak eh , okay I was interpreting for my granother .
Yea .
So I was using the two languages : Kikuyu na Kizungu
Mh hhh .
In such a situation , you must use the two languages so that you can bring these people together to understand each other .
Mh hhh .
Ndio .
The language you use with friends ,
Yes .
do you use the same language with your lecturers maybe ?
Definitely no . With my friends , we are very free . We can discuss anything .
Mh hhh .
But with my lecturers , we just use academic language .
Mh hhh .
How is the script ? How did I perform in my part ?
Mh hhh .
You know , a language that is just academic . But with my friends ?
Mh hhh .
Ah ! Vitu vingi sana . Kwa hivo lugha ni tofauti . Kikuyu , Kiswahili , tunacheza na [ uncertain transcription ] ya lugha tofauti .
Mh hhh .
Hivyo kabisa .
Wewe umejaribu kwa wakati mwengine ,
Naam .
kubadilisha vile ambavyo unavyo ongea .
Aah-
Na ni kwa sababu gani ukawa unoana kwamba unabidi umebadilisha ?
Mh hhh .
Mh hhh .
Sidhani kuna wakati difikani [ uncertain transcription ] nikabadilisha vile mnavyo ongea .
Mhh naam .
Vile tu nilikuwa the way I sp- , ah , m- the way I 'm speaking today ,
Mh hhh .
Definitely , probably ime- imekuwa better ,
Mh hhh .
it because of age and education vitu kama izo , but I sijachenji sana . Kidogo , kama nime change ni kidogo . Na it 's only getting better because of e- ? Education na exposure .
Mh hhh .
Ndio .
So , o- okay . You talk of exposure .
Mhh .
What kind of exposure ?
Aah , unajua sasa , sa ii -right now I ’m in campus .
Mh hhh .
So I definitely have ah , read so many books .
Ah huh .
Slo [ uncertain transcription ] known , several or so many vocabularies in English or in Kiswahili .
Mh hhh .
As well in Kikuyu because as you grow , you know ,
Mh hhh .
things or language develops every day and you meet different people .
Mh hhh .
Different media give you different ideas .
Mh hhh .
That is the kind of exposure I 'm talking about .
Kuna marafiki ambao pengine ,
Mh hhh .
umejaribu kuwaiga
Mhh .
kwa wakati mmoja
Mhh .
kulingana na vile ambavyo wanavyo ongea ?
Ah , I used to imitate news anchors and presenters and reporters .
Mh hhh .
And even today tukipatana tu na mabeshdi , we just , you want to , when you are talking about , you know , I 'm in linguistics and media communications .
Mhh .
So , sometimes these topics do n't eeh , we do n't avoid .
Mhh
So once a , once in a while , you just mention a person and several friends would want imitate such a friend
Mhh
or such a reporter or such an anchor .
Mhh .
Yes .
What reasons do they give as they imitate ? Do you think or they believe that that is the language they should be speaking ?
I , I think we take it like , that if you speak like that person , it is either : you are going to know what that person knows or-
Mh hhh .
be like that person .
Mh hhh .
Yes .
Okay .
Maybe , maybe we would be appreciated the way that person is appreciated in the society .
Mh hhh .
Yes .
So that your current language , the current language that you use-
Yes .
You , you think it 's lacking somethings that this other person has ?
Aah , probably . Kwa sababu , you see there are reporters , you know they use language ,
Okay .
and eh , that language , the language they use is the one that makes them be attractive to the audience .
Okay .
So unafikiri : ukizungumza kama yeye , utajua maneno ambayo anayotumia .
Mh hhh .
And you 'd be , i-it would become an easy way of you to understand lang- to use language , like them . So you definitely think they are speaking better than you . Lakini wakati mwingine inawezekana si inaweza kuwa(laughing ) siyo hivyo .
Now , now you and your friends ,
Yes .
what issues do you talk about these days ?
Ah , with my friends , we talk about eh , [ uncertain transcription ] future , we talk about girls ,
Yea .
we talk about making money .
Mh hhh .
Ev- eh , either here or after school ,
Mh hhh .
because you 're almost and eh , sometimes we do n't avoid politics . Whether you are talking about what happened in nineteen ninety two , two thousand and two ,
Mh hhh .
or what you think will happen in twenty seventeen ,
Mhh .
we can n't avoid politics .
Mh hhh .
And uh , magari pia . We talk about cars .
Mh hhh .
Eh .
Pengine mna madhumuni yapi mnavyo , mnapo ongea kuhusu mambo haya ?
Aah . Probably , it 's the age that we are in , because right now , we just coming out of school and tumeona watu . We have seen experiences of people ,
Okay .
people al- , people will tell you : aah , we did this when we are on our final year in campus .
Mhh .
So we think : ah , if my cousin was able to buy a piece of land after campus , why can n't we form a group at least , if I can n't buy it myself , we buy it together .
Mh hhh .
Then we can develop it , and , you know , have some money ., because my cousin actually did that .
Mh hhh .
Um , by the time alikuwa anamaliza campus , alikuwa amesave pesa na akanunua a piece of land .
Mh hhh .
E ee .
Kuna baadhi ya marafiki amba- amba- ambao huwezi kuya- kuyaongea mambo haya ,
Mhh .
unaweza wataja na ni kwa sababu gani , na ni- na marafika- marafiki hawa ni wa hali gani ? Hasa sema kwamba wanatoka uhn , mijini ama wanatoka wa shambani ?
Aah , marafiki wangu wengi , wametoka mashambani .
Naam .
But there are few of those who are from eh , you know , urban towns-
Okay .
or urban cities . Wale ambao wametoka mashambani , when I talk of buying a piece of land , at least those ones will understand me .
Yea .
But tell a person from a , the city that you want to buy a piece of land , they would n't see the need .
Mh hhh .
Wao wamekuwa wakijuwa the piece of land they have , probably the stocks exchanges , so they would think of investing in such areas .
Mh hhh .
Watu ambao wametoka kwa mashambani , they want to build a house , maybe they want to build estates , a rental estates . But wale watu ambao wako kwa cities , they think of , you know they think differently from people from the rural areas .
Okay .
Kwa hivo tunazungumza tu tofauti .
Mh hhh .
E ee .
Okay Mhh ( clears throat ) . Even as you talk this friends ,
Mhh .
let 's talk of , uh , the financial issues . Do you have the same , like thoughts when you talk about financial issues with all your friends or there are some friends who have got another perspective of finances ?
Bila shaka .
Mh hhh .
Nitakupea scenario ya my two friends .
Okay .
Kuna rafiki yangu mmoja , yeye kazi yake ni kutumia pesa . He justs spends and spends and spends .
Mh hhh .
Lakini kuna rafiki yangu mwingine whose work or whose idea is saving money .
Okay .
Aah , I have a friend , I do n't want to give names ,
Mh hhh .
but I have a friend who 's , who just , you know , buys things , phones , glasses ,
Mh hhh .
drinks . That is one , one of my friends . And then I have another one who does n't use anything , just basics , and the rest , he saves .
Mh hhh .
Yes .
And what-
So definitely I would use different language , financial language . Nikienda kwa huyo anatumia ,
Mh hhh .
aah , itakuwa ngumu kuelewana na yeye . Kwa sababu pia mimi sitaki kutumia kama anavyotumia , probably he has more money than ? Than me .
Uh huhn .
So I would use somebody who will show me hakiba haiozi . That is eh , what you keep , you know , if you keep something , you just keep it . It does n't get eh , rotten ,
Mhh .
so to speak . Yes .
Okay . Do you talk about investment matters ?
Yes we talk about investment matters .
Mh hhh .
Na kama mtu unaona ah , kuna pesa mingi ,
Naam .
labda we utaenda hapo u- umuulize vile wewe pia unaweza na invest yake kwa sababu hii inaonyesha , ame invest pesa pale f- mzuri .
Mh hhh .
Pale pesa ina- iwe ina generate -
Mh hhh .
more money .
Okay .
Kwa sababu we pia hauna pesa mingi you want to be like him .
Mh hhh .
So utaenda umwambia akuonyesha pahali uta invest zako pia .
Okay .
Kama mtu hana pesa nyingi ,
Mh hhh .
and I have some money , I 'd talk to the person and maybe tell him where we can invest .
Mh hhh .
Yes .
Naam . Nishukuru sana kwa muda wako .
Asante sana .
Na nishukuru tena kwa jumla ya mawazo mmenipatia leo .
Asante .
Ah .
Thank you .
Siku njema .
A aa , nawe pia .
