 It's only spoken in uh: maybe:-now because Sheng, probably if you look at the language-if for instance you go to Tanzania, there are a group of people who don't speak pure Swahili.  You'll find some words from there-the different communities that are there. So it's not an international language. So if we were to put it to be official or if we were to encourage people to use it, somebody gets so used to it-maybe you travel to: for instance you travel to Germany, you will not find people who speak Sheng there. So you'll find it very hard communicating, simply because you are used to speaking to Sheng.  But if you speak to-uh-in English, English is ver-is an international language, if you go to whatever country you go to, you'll find-even if you go to France you'll still find people speaking in? In English.  You can go to Germany, it applies there. So Sheng, the only thing you can do to it is sensitize people.  Cuz if again you'll want to, like root Sheng out of the languages, this means that you're going to kill a lot of-especially the musicians.  In Kenya most-the musicians especially the local artists use Sheng.  And this is how it has influenced-and apart from that, if you look at the media. Right now we've got individuals who are in the media.  They don't use that-the language they use it's purely Sheng or at times that broken Swahili.  Cuz if you look at QFM, the guy who you, they are just there. And most stations nowadays they're embracing them because they want audience, they want people to listen to them.  Cuz if you-like it's a station that speaks uses-for instance ABC, that you've got none of this comedians there who maybe speak very broken.  For instance if you look at somebody like Jelaa, who says maybe </Sheng label='exemplification'>kalamu changu</Sheng label='exemplification'> (chuckles).  So, you'll find that-
