So thank you for your time . Thank you for making time for this conversation , about language use . Yea and I will start off by asking you , what language do you typically use at home ?
Aah , at home I-I usually use Kiswahili , with a bit of mother tongue . That is , Bukusu a subtribe of the Luya .
Mm hmm . Why do you use Kiswahili ? Luya too ?
I use Kiswahili because I find it more friendly .
Yes ?
And li-with my parents I find it easy to use Kiswahili than I could express myself in vernacular , cuz I 'm not as well so competent with vernacular .
Okay , haujui Kibukusu vizuri ?
Ai , sija master vyema { that 's } why nina-nikijaribu kukiongea napata nachekwa =
{ Why ? }
{ So , so I normally} =
( laughing ) { Unachekwa na -Is it } because you-you did n't grow up in-in-in a Luya : Bukusu kind of setting ? Or it 's just-what do you think is the reason ?
Maybe that 's one of the reasons but then , it 's not a major reason . { That 's only because I =}
{ Then what is the major reason ? }
It 's b- , I think-it 's-it 's funny , indeed . My dad used to be a Kiswahili teacher .
Aaaah .
So we knew it in school he is so competent , [ uncertain transcription ] . And then you { just adopted a culture } .
{ You-you find yourself-} That 's your dad . How about your mom ?
My mom is-she 's just-she 's at home , she 's um [ uncertain transcription ] .
Yea but I mean why-she 's not a Kiswahili teacher so why do n't you use Bukusu with her ?
Yea , I just got used to much of Kiswahili .
Mmm . Like me , I 'm not very fluent in my mother tongue but I 'll never be ashamed of using my mother tongue na mamangu . Because she 'd not laugh at me , she 'll correct me . Do you use some Luya with her ?
Yea .
Your mother ?
Usually I think normally when you are in the kitchen =
Eh hee . When nobody else is-is listening .
Yea . When nobody else is listening .
Do you have a brothers ama na sisters ?
Yes , I have one brother and two sisters .
Eh he . So which language do you use with them ?
I-usually Kiswahili with a bit of English .
With a bit of -this time with English now ?
Yea , English .
Mm hmm . Do you ever use English with your- wazazi wako ?
Wazazi , English ? Yea , occasionally . But not aah =
But with your : brothers and sisters ? So when you say English and Kiswahili , your brothers and sisters does it mean also Sheng ? Like you are mixing the two or ?
Mmh , usually I try to shun Sheng , eh ?
To shun Sheng ?
Yea , just to make sure that it does n't have any negative impact on my-the offic-when it comes to official communications . I remember sometime when I was still in primary school I-I almost adopted too much of Sheng .
Mmm hmm .
And it could-it-it-it almost brought complications to my Kiswahili .
It was affecting your =
It was affecting me =
Performance in school ?
Yes .
Ok . { You had } developed some attitude-negative attitude towards it ?
{ And so I =} Yea , but not much negative =
But now you campus . Do you use Sheng ?
Sheng I-I do n't use it , always . And I can say I am not always-I 'm not always willing . Unless I 'm=
Somebody =
Somebody communicates but then I wo n't object to that . I will just answer-just to make sure that the other par t-t he other party =
Is this parties you are referring to are your friends ?
Yea my friends .
Rafiki zako hapa in campus ?
Ndio .
Soo , which language would you use with them , these friends in campus ?
In campus I normally get myself using Kiswahili-
Mmh hmm .
Yea . And when you 're in these-in the academic streets and also maybe in the highway that 's where we meet . Usually and mostly we try to use English .
English ?
Yea , and though in the rooms I would just use any language . But then my roommate is-is aah , Kiswahili and History student in the school of Education so we try so much to apply the use of Kiswahili .
Mm hmm . Mh mmh . These are your friends in-in-in campus ?
Yes .
How about your friends at home ?
At home : , I-I remember : , usually I 'm not-I-when at home , I usually stay indoors unless it is on a weekend and then I 'm going for-to worship in the church . And so you see , in the church you can n't use much of Sheng . Cuz aah , we take to Sheng it actually =
So most of your friends are in church ?
In the churches [ uncertain transcription ]
So which languages do you use with them ?
We use Kiswahili , for those who are : less privileged in terms of literacy . Yea , but for those ones in the same capacity as I am maybe in the university , we use pure Kiswahili .
Pure Kiswahili .
Yea and-and English =
Mm hmm , because this other Kiswahili which-which Kiswahili is it ?
We call it , Kiswahili sanifu .
Yea , I know that is the pure one . This other one that you use with hawa ninii label='exclusion ' , tha t-t hose guys wenye umesema aah , challenge in terms of-yea , they are not at the same level as you are . Which Kiswahil-because you said you use Kiswahili with them .
Yes .
Wha-What type of Kiswahili is it ?
I think to me there is that Kiswahili which is most ah-I can say frankly because you can speak it . Yea , without much- .. without much eh-tension . Let me say kuna vile Kiswahili tuna : ongea-tunasema-tunakiita cha jikoni . Tunasema “ kujako ” ? [ uncertain transcription ] such language that we do n't [ uncertain transcription] =
Which is not , nini sio Kiswahili sanifu =
Because they 've not learned [ uncertain transcription ] to-to learn the , kile Kiswahili sanifu .
Mm . So you try to accommodate them .
Yea , to accommodate them .
So that they-they do n't feel like “ eesh , huyu jamaa amesoma sana na , anatuonyesha vile amesoma ”
Yea .
Mmh ? Ok . So you do n't [ uncertain transcription ]
Yea . Just to make sure you are communicating with them .
That 's all . Okay . Ee : tell me again , apart- in school here which languages do you use ?
In school here : I-I use-first as I had mentioned earlier , Kiswahili when-when I 'm in the room and more so maybe in the streets I 'm meeting my friends .
Yes .
And especially my LMC colleagues .
Yes .
Then you have English . That 's for the o-peop-official purposes mostly when you [ uncertain transcription ] And then , toward on that I 'm-now that I 'm-I 'm-I 'm a foreign language student , I uh =
Aaah ! Yea , yea yea [ uncertain transcription ]
Yea , I 'm pursuing , my French studies .
Mm hmm . How-how are you-how fluent are you in French ?
I 'm not that much fluent but ah-I 'm trying to be competent . I 'm trying to be fluent .
But you can communicate in French .
But I can communicate .
You can communicate ?
Yes .
With eh , fellow students , with your friends , with your lecturers ?
Friends and lecturers , yea .
So when do you use the French ?
More so I can state in the class and in the classes . Yes , that 's one . And then when communicating- now that I 'm a class representative of my group eh , we : usually use French when communicating with course lecturers . They expect you course lecturers that 's maybe in text or-just , on-on our phone calls trying to arrange for classes and other activities . Yea .
Do you think it 's important to know English ?
Yea , it 's very important to know English .
[ uncertain transcription ] important to know English ?
I think-I remember there was one motivational speaker who came to my former high school , that is Bungoma High School [ uncertain transcription ] . By then I was a finalist in-in 2009 . He : tried to convince me so much . He said everybody should know English . Why ? At-as you can see , from the look of things . From-it 's all over the world , English is the language of-I think it 's-diplomacy and-yea , something like commerce . And so , when I try-when I sit down and try to recapture my life and try to conjoin to the future . With the kind of person I would like to be , it is really necessary that I know English because I 'm also attracted towards the area of diplomacy and public relations . So as well I would like to be . It 's my blood that it 's=
Huyu m-na huyu mtu , alikuwa Mkenya ? This motivational speaker ?
Yea , alikuwa Mkenya . Yea . He was one of those competent English and literature teachers high school . And he is currently in-in Buka Academy .
Oh okay . So he 's somebody you : aire the way they use English ?
I aired the way he used it .
He uses English ?
Yes .
Uh huh . Soo mainly for dip-for career because you had told me your interest is-is the diplomacy [ uncertain transcription ] . So Kingereza kwako ni career . Ile -because of career . Is it ? { Is that what you 're telling me ? }
{ And not only-not only career } , as well , English is everywhere . And when you go to most countries , even in France , you will get to know that at least there 's some-a-there 's a fraction of the French who speak English . So when you fail-I-wi-maybe on my side when I will at one point fail , to be competent in French I would try to switch to English so just weigh , is there anybody I would be communicating to ? In that language ? But to me =
You know , for you , you are doing French . So you have an advantage over other students mostly in Kenya because mostly people do English , as a foreign language . Right ?
Yes .
So what advantage do you think you have by knowing French ?.. That is different from those ones who know English ?
By knowing French eh ? I-on my side-and I so believe that actually as just you have stated that I tend to have an added advantage over the rest because one , I have one more foreign language , maybe when you go to [ uncertain transcription ] . If-when I [ uncertain transcription ] that fluent in French , when I go outside , let 's say overseas , I 'll have more chances exposed to job opportunities than that one who have done { English only } . Let 's go-say for example in Canada , they speak English and French as well . But when I go there I will have more chances-maybe-when I go there as an instructor maybe I will have specialized and I 'm a professional in certain fields . You get to know that when there 's a chance there to teach , they will-I 'm-I 'm sure they will take me .
{ Only English } . Mmh , it seems uko na dreams za kuenda abroad ?
Yea . Those are my-some of my dreams . God willing .
God willing .
If God allows I 'll =
Mmm , I wish you had [ uncertain transcription ] you can have that chance eh ?
Thank you .
And : how about nini-this mother tongue , native language ? Do you think it 's important for anyone to know our native languages ?
Yes . It 's , very vital to know .
It 's vital ?
Yea it 's vital { because you 're}= .
{ But then you are contradicting } yourself because you told me you have a problem [ uncertain transcription ] for you you feel ashamed .
Yea , actually the reason behind the feeling ashamed actually it was the discouragement ,
Yea . From people ?
Yea , from people .
Because you { tried to speak it} ?
{ In fact } Yes . In fact neighbors-I get-and the relatives . They are so much into Bukusu such that when I try to speak , they laugh at you . They say “ Now are you really a Bukusu ? ”
( Laughs ) So why is it important ? { You say it 's vital } .
{ It 's important because } Yea , it 's important in this way eh ? They have those rituals . Eh maybe the celebrations zile sherehe they come together . When you are together actually it feels so .. more at home when you use one language then to use an- maybe in my capacity now that I 'm a university student . It will feel so much awkward , to try and maintain Kiswahili or English other than using my mother tongue , that is Kiswahili with other members . And there are some other things when , the-the-let 's say tunaziita kanuni za utamaduni . Hauwezi ukazielewa vyuma vile bila kuelewa Kibukusu . Nikijichukulia mimi mwenyewe .
Mm hmm . I 've lived with Bukusus . And I-you 're-you 're a very interesting culture , especially when it comes to nini-eeh : right of passage .
Yes .
What do you call it ?
The .. tohara .
Tohara .
Yes .
Mmm . Very interesting . So you think it 's important for such cultural things-to know Bukusu for you ?
Yea . As in-in order to carry out the mm : =
Just to feel part of the community .
( Pause ) The tohara -the tohara : =
No , no , not the act of tohara . Because it 's always an event that people follow , people are happy , people dance . Would you want to know-I mean would Bukusu-knowing Bukusu help you like mingle and-and ,
Yes , it will really help . It comes in handy .
You said those events tha t-t hat you feel you need to know that your language . What else ? What other reasons do you think .. your native language is important for you ? { And not just } [ uncertain transcription ] any other people because Kenya we have got some forty two
{ Yea , I think } Mm , yea really it 's im-it 's-it 's important to know even as many vernacular languages as possible because trust me . When-let me say I am only competent in English , Kiswahili and my vernacular Kibukusu . When I 've-when taken to Central , be sure , kule mashinani ( grassroots , trenches ) Central , I wo n't survive . Because , not-not-mm , various regions-ai , all over the world you never get intellectuals only . You get as well those who-those people who 've just stuck to their native languages . Yea , like I-I can give an example from my community . There are those people you can talk to them in Kiswahili and then you wo n't get a response you wont ' be communicating . Yea .
Mm . But do n't you think that is encouraging tribalism ?
Yea .
[ uncertain transcription ] tunasema kila siku .
Yea , that encourages tribalism so much .
Do you think-so you think also now our native language is not good . Because of-of issues na ukabila ?
Yea , it 's good to know them . But you-yea , know them for their positive reasons and not for the =
So do you think the positive reasons outweigh the negative ?
At the moment I can say as for the situation in Kenya the negative reasons outweigh the positive ones .
But is it-is it the language that is the problem , or the people ?
( Long pause ) Yea , to me it 's=
Is it the language or the people ? { It 's separate things }
I think the { people , the people . } Yea , yea , people are the problem . Yes .
Mm hmm . Wenye wanatumia ninii vibaya . Hayo mambo kuhusu [ uncertain transcription ] so you think it 's the people . But the language itself is , there 's nothing wrong with it .
Nothing wrong because when you try to go to the origin of the language . It 's God himself who created mankind . Na akaumba pia na-aliwawezesha kuwa na ndimi tofauti tofauti so you cannot say God created mankind for the negative reason , no . Aliwaumba waishi pamoja kwa amani na upendo . Because you see Jesus Christ anakuona anasema ' oh ... love is the greatest command . And then you try to consider the tribal lines eh ? Or rather the languages you speak , you wo n't-you-you wo n't maintain a [ uncertain transcription ] utakuwa una clash kilamara . So it 's good to avoid like I 'm here-almost Bukusa [ uncertain transcription ] . So I should not look at the aspect of a language . When I try to consider that so much-you get that you- utakuwa na ile distance . So in : -in short you should- mnaona kama mwanadamu mmoja , we live together kusaidiana kwa upendo kwasababu nikikupenda tutasaidiana . Sita angalia the negative sides of your language or the-the stereotypes at large . You wo n't be getting so much into those .
Do you find yourself mixing languages in-in one conversation ?
Yea , { I-I find} =
{ Which languages } are these that you mix ?
In Kiswahili and English mostly .
Kiswahili and English mostly ?
Yes .
Mm hmm . What they usually call Sheng .
( Giggles )
When-when do you usually mix languages ?
Actually I-I can conf-I : ll have to confess that sometimes you run short of words .
You run short of words .
When communicating .
In which language ?
Maybe : may-maybe both eh ? Because you might be communicating in Kiswahili , you reach somewhere you want to communicate something then , you get stuck . So you have to:-you-there 's a word you have to chip in , from English so tha t-t o make sure that , aah you { communicate that} =
{ Whoever you are talking to } is understanding what you are saying .
Yes .
Do you even want to say that you are not fluent in Kiswahili ?
Yea , I 'm not yet fluent .
Or English . You 're not , completely fluent .
I 'm not completely fluent .
So sometimes you have problems ?
Yea .
Tha t-t hat need- that make you ... I mean switch the languages or mix the languages .
Yea , yea .
Mm hmm . Any other reason apart from , lacking the-the-the words to use ?
( Long pause ) I think uuh , from lacking the words-aah , maybe you : might do that- you-you call it codeswitching . Just to make the conversation interesting .
Mm hmm . To make the conversation interesting .
Yes , maybe { you [ uncertain transcription]} =
{ To who now ? }
To-to [ uncertain transcription ] . To whoever =
And when you are mixing is it-is it to-with your lecturers ? Is it with your friends ? Is it with , your parents ? Eh he ? Whom do you tend to-to-to do the codemixing with ?
I think when it comes to the academic instructors , that is in the academic field I 'll-I will always make sure that I try to be concise eh ? There would not be that much word use so to the extent that I would engage into codeswitching .
Mm hmm .
So I : just do-
One language if it is =
One language yea .
English =
English .
Is it usually English ?
English yea usually English .
With your instructors .
Yea . So with code switching I get myself doing that-practicing that when it is the case with friends and parents . Because-yea actually parents are that friendly . They are not that much formal .
Mmm . They 're not strict { hawajasema }
{ They 're not strict . }
“ You need to use this language ”
Yes . And as well , it-it would be a very bad image to-to codeswitch before your instructor .
Mm hmm . Mm okay . Umewahiona any difference between the way you speak and the way other students ... talk ?
[ uncertain transcription ] it 's very possible , I 've seen that =
What-what kind of differences have you observed ?
Yea , it 's in many ways . I 've found out that um , there are those students who are most fluent than I am . More fluent than I am ah , { when it comes to Kiswahili }
{ English , Kiswahili mm hm }
Especially the Kiswahili students . Those [ uncertain transcription ] , yea they have -- they try to be very much fluent and can-I cannot measure up to their standards . And then there are those students as well who are very good and competent in English , and I cannot as well measure up to their standard . That 's .. how I ” ve seen it . And there are those ones who are deep into Sheng . And I am-me I 'm not deep into Sheng .
You 're not deep into Sheng .
Yes .
And there 's sometimes talk-because wengine wanazungumza Sheng mpaka hupati wanasema nini .
Yea , mpaka sipati .
Eeh ? It 's possible .
Yea .
And where do you think this [ uncertain transcription ] students comes from what ?
I think some would just come from the same home . Yea , that 's from the various parts of the country [ uncertain transcription] =
So there are people from your area-home area that speak Sheng that you cannot understand ?
That I cannot understand .
And for you .. it seems to me like hauna interest with Sheng so much .
Yea I do n't-yea I can refer you back to =
You choose to know , but you do n't-you were saying you can refer back to ?
To : -to a case I related to you that I-I remember in Standard 8 , it almost affected me .
Yea , yea , yea , yea . So that you have a negative attitude .
Yea , [ uncertain transcription ] It 's not a total dislike , but I try not to use much of it .
Much of it . Okay . Do you by the way-did you pass your : languages .. in =
In primary ?
In primary I 'd say or did it affect so-you so much that you did n't pass OA .
I remember I got an A minus in Kiswahili .
Aaaah
And a B plus in English .
Which is-which are good grades . Mm . So you quickly changed that ( laughter ) okay . Eeh , can you tell , if someone comes from your area ? Your home area ? From the way they talk ? { Is it } possible ?
{ Yea , I can-} I can tell . Even though for others it 's been that difficult to tell .
Mm hmm . For who ? You 're saying , although it can be =
I can tell that this one-this-m-this person comes from my home area , that is when it comes to maybe : -maybe : by using-maybe to-just to : identifying by the language , yea .
How do you do that ?
I-with us the Luhya 's usually you have the-there 's that tunaita is it lahaja or the :
Accent ?
Accent . Yea . Unapata mtu anaongea “ ebu kuja ” “ patro dogo ” instead of bado kidogo . Yea and such ( interviewer laughs ) [ uncertain transcription ] . We call it mother tongue interference
Is it only you : Bukusu or Luhya that do that ?
I think there are much eh ? Yea , toward on that , I think most Luhyas have that . And then , there 's-actually I 'll try to understand something from the : -from the interactions I 've had with my friends . I 've had to communicate-I 've been conversing with my friends and then they tell me “ actually , there 's a word there 's something you spoke and then I could identify that you are a Bukusu . Or a Luhya . ” There 's this-this tendency of adding , kuongeza maneno kwa-mengine . For example ' kujang 'o ' ' kujako kidogo ' .
Kujako . [{ uncertain transcription }] , those are mostly Luhya 's [ uncertain transcription ] .
{ Kujako . Such } Yes .
Mm hmm . How about [ transcription ] from other areas ? Can you [ uncertain transcription ] from other areas ?
Actually I am not in a position to discover that unless I do a [ uncertain transcription ] { research } .
{ Because } [ uncertain transcription ] if you talk of mother tongue interference , everybody-okay , most people from all over Kenya have some kind of interference .
Yes .
Is-is that something you can use to tell you where somebody comes from ?
Yea , I 'm sure . It can work that way . It 's only that I 've not delved so much into trying to discover it . Yes .
How about eeh-somebody 's background ? Their level of education , things like their position in society : , political affiliation . Can you tell from the way they talk , even if you cannot see them ?
From the way they talk ?
Somebody talking in-in say the other room , you cannot see that person can you tell their background ?
Yea .
In terms of level of education for example ?
I 'm sure you can .
You can ? { How [ uncertain transcription ]}
Yea . { Even though-} even though it 's not good to be that judgmental , but you can tell actually . Yea . Let me say , it 's not for you that I am saying this eh ? For those people maybe who are from the-you are trying to say something like “ how can you [ uncertain transcription ] between social status and standards ?
Yes .
You will get-usually those people from rich families , you will get them talking of some complicated-using complicated terms in speech . Or somebody using-they 're-they 're so much into technology , somebody saying “ mazee hii ipad [ uncertain transcription ] sijui buda ameninunulia ipad fulani huko juu ” such things . Just to .. give an example . Somebody talking of a maybe : ... they-they-the-the types of vehicles eh ? They have tried to make sure that they are knowing most of the types of vehicles . Why ? Maybe it 's because they 're exposed to them by the : -by the virtue of their parents buying them . So you could tell-though they 're discussing that so you could tell . This one must be from a-a bit-[uncertain transcription ] , like for me and my case uh ? I-I must confess I 'm from that , lower standards . So you get me I 'm not-I do n't know much about the technology and the luxuries so we talk simple stories . Yea . Maybe discussing about , ( interviewer says something inaudible in the background ) favorite foods eh ?
Favorite foods .
How ugali can be cooked . ( Both break out in loud laughter )
Sasa hivyo ndio kuna nini eh ? [ Still laughing robustly ]
Such simple- not necessarily about food but-{yea }
{ yea }
Simple , simple things .
Mm , but these are- hawa wengine ni : mostly =
Tend to be complicated .
Complex things . They do n't have time for small , matters ?
Yes .
So you can tell somebody 's level of education .
Yea , but the level of education { you can tell} =
{ you can tell-} you said your position in society . { Class , yes , yes } , all that , you can do that .
{ Yes . Yes . }
How about level of education ? Because , you can have somebody from a poor background , somebody from a rich background both of them are professors or doctors or : high-I mean with high level of education . Can you tell them apart ?
Yes , well , when it comes to the level of educat-education it 's very much possible to tell . Yea , from the time of-from the kind of language and-and I think this comes to the kind of vocabulary . Yea . Used-you 'll-when you-when it comes to that person who has been that less fortunate , has not of attained an education to maybe say .. university . Let 's say it 's somebody who just reached Form Four aaa Standard Eight drop-out , you tend to s-to discover that these people usually they 're not-like in Kenya , English-when it comes to English they 're not that competent . Yea , it 's impossible to be that much fluent eh ? When your level of education is a bit down . But you get to people like professors , even from-when conversing eh ? You 'll discover that they 're some terms they use-there are those big words yea . And so you 'll tell .
You can easily tell .
Yea . You can easily tell .
Mm hmm . Okay . Do you speak-because you told me that you know English , Kiswahili , Bukusu and also French . So do you use-or do you speak thes-these different languages to different people ?
Yes , I use them to { different people for example }
{ Give me an example , when ? }
Let 's start with French eh ? I can n't speak French to my roommate because it 's a fact that French students in Moi University main campus are so few , and so to say- it 's not applicable to most students because you can n't understand it . [ uncertain transcription ] because the problem with accent because even you can be knowing- .. that you can-even though it 's possible to get that-a certain word spoken that could be meaning this but the accent puts you off if you are not conversant to it . And then , when it comes to : English as well I would use it to almost everybody but not to the : -most of the people in my community-most of the people in my community actually do n't know English . Especially the elderly . Yea . When talking to them in English , you are just being .. unfair to them .
Mm hmm .
Yea . So and as well English I wo n't use much of English to my younger-let 's say the-the five years old and below .
Did you mention Kiswahili ?
Yea , Kiswahili : as well . Kiswahili : -Kiswahili actually , in as much as it is our national language in Kenya specifically , it is-it has proved to be that complicated .
Mm hmm .
Yea , especially when : you dwell so much into Kiswahili sanifu , it puts off many- even most of our instructors , lecturers there are those ones who specialize in those fields
Yea .
Yea , they teach in English so much that when you talk to them in Kiswahili sanifu they wo n't be getting you but the normal Kiswahili , ah there 's no problem .
Mm hmm . Bukusu ?
Bukusu I 'll specifically use it to people from my community or any other individual who has proved to be competent in it or not-knowing a bit of it .
So even me as a Kalenjin knows some Bukusu =
Yes , we can still communicate .
I believe my mom knows Bukusu very well , so you can talk to her ( laughs ) . Or she can teach actually [ uncertain transcription ] your Bukusu is not so good . She will speak like a Kik-a Bukusu kabisa .... Umm , have you ever tried to change .. anything about the way you talk ?
Changing :
Anything .
With the way I talk ?
Yea , because you s- I asked you previously if you had noticed a difference from the way you talk eh ? How other students talk . So you say there are differences ?
Yea , there are differences .
Some are like more fluent in Kiswahili , others in Sheng , like that eh ? So have you ever chang-tried to change anything about the way you talk ?
Yes I have tried to change .
Why ?
How ?
Mm hmm .
It 's this way eh ? I ” ll-when I came first to : first year , I almost tried to identify myself with , let me say-it 's unfortunate but let me say the majority . Yea . When you come into campus there are those teenagers-yea , should we call them teenagers-no , not teenagers but my age mates . { My peers } .
Peers . { Your peers }
Me I would come here najaribu kuongea I want to identify with Sheng so much . And then I discovered something-you know I just remembered something . This same Sheng almost cost me . So , yes I tried to communicate to them in Sheng but I saw a reason to change . Not to dwell into it so much . Because I saw how it could lead to some repercussions , now that I 'm a language student . Yea . As well , that is one instance . And I said that those people who speak more fluently in Kiswahili than I am-than I can , that is . So , I tried to change actually . I tried to make sure that I maintain Kiswahili sanifu at some point when I get somebody who is fluent in Kiswahili you try to converse . Just to make sure I-by that I tried =
So consciously saying “ wacha nijaribu kabisa , ni ma-nimaintain hiyo Kiswahili . Uh huh .
Ee , ndio .
So you-you do that ? { Often ? }
{ I do that } even though I do n't-{I do n't}=
{ You do that often ? } Do you do it often like everyday ?
Not everyday because sometimes we do n't meet with those friends of mine who do Kiswahili . Yea or { who would do} =
{ English ? }
English ?
Have you also tried to change the way you talk ?
Yea , I have tried to make sure that I do n't mix the-the usual grammatical errors I used to make .. sometime ago .
