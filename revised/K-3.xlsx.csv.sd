Ok .. so thank you for your time , thank you for taking your time for this interviwe , we are going to talk about the way we use language in everyday life yah , anything to do with the your leisure activities for example . So I will just have a few questions and we disuss about this , so first of all I want to know which language do you speak with your family ?
Ok , we use Luo a lot coz you know have been bred in Kisumu , live in Kisumu whole of my life . So practically we use Luo a lot , English and Swahili is rare yah .
Why do you use Luo a lot ?
Because we are use to it as in , ok my parents both were bred in the Luo land areas which is really Seme ( name of place in Kisumu ) the other one was in Kisumu just next to Seme so you know there is no chance for English or Swahili .
So you are very fluent in Luo ?
Yah ( agree ) I am very fluent .
Very fluent and you can speak it .
I speak it all the time actually …. ( interrupted )
All the time not just at home ?
No .. no I speak it all the time unless it 's very official bussiness then you find me speaking maybe English or Swahili yah .
You will tell me more about that coz I will also be intrested that you know here on campus you also speak Luo ?
Yah ( agree ) I speak Luo with my friends … (interrupted )
With your Luo friends …
Mmmm ( agree ) ok but others if maybe they are not getting the language I 'll have to translate coz I speak it at times I forget and speak Luo then I 'll say " ahh !! I was saying this "
Even when a person is not a Luo . ( both laughs ) So when you see a person like this , the first language that comes to your mind …
Not Luo not Luo .. ( both laughs ) .
But when you see a Luo the first language that comes to your mind ... ( interrupted )
Of course I will shout in Luo ask him where is going to … yah yah ( agree )
when you see a person that is ….. ( not clear ) how about with your friends , what language do you use ? Your friends at home not here .
At home we use mother tongue coz many us we are Luo 's so you will find us speaking mother tongue unless we discussing something like shoes , maybe clothes .
You discuss shoes in Deluo ?
Ok it ’s hard you know the type of shoes you know we just know the names in English will just say like for example " wage " (nickname of a shoe ) you cannot tell somebody in Luo what wage means now you know you will have to discuss in Swahili .
Wage would be the fashion that time so you will want to really wear the wage
Most probably ( both laughs )
So your friends mostly Luo ..
We speak in Luo when we picking ( catching up ) on one another especially …… (pause )
Ohh !! Ok .
Yah , we pick on each other a lot mmh !
You are teasing yah . So Luo is the best to do the teasing .
Yah yah ( agree ) .
Ok and how about those friends of yours at home who are not Luo speakers ?
Ok , the ones who are not Luo speakers , you 'll find maybe they have to learn because that ’s the oder of the day . It ’snot like you know ok when ahh … before I came to Eldoret ( name of town ) you know I was like " when I go this Moi University probably I will find everybody speaking in Kalenjin in the town everybody is speaking , the business taking place in Kalenjin " coz you know ... ( interrupted )
Because you are here you are that ….. ( not clear )
Kisumu everywhere is Luo even in a motorcyclist(medium of transport ) they do n’t know your tribe … (interrupted )
Even motorcyclist ?
Eaah ! ( agree ) they will not ask you your tribe they will just ask you " where are you going ? " in mother tongue .
Just say it in mother tongue ?
Ok let me ask " Ethi-kanye ? " (Luo native ) they will be like " am going this way " you know … (interrupted )
Athi ( Luo native language ) is home or something … mmh .
Yah ( agree ) so you know unajua it 's just the nom even if you go to a shop they will ask you what you want in mother tongue and such stuff . So you know when I was coming this side I was oh my God I am going to be doomed what am I going to … (interrupted )
when you alight in Eldoret … Mmm
Yah ( agree ) , how will I even talk to people ? Where will I know am going to ? until now but when I come to this side people really do n’t speak their language as much Luo do yah ( agree ) , they speak a lot of Swahili especially , so I was like this people are so different I got embarrased .. ( interrupted ) .
What was the reason ?
I do n’t know maybe Luos you know Luos bragg(show off ) a lot ( both laugh ) , So you know we are too proud(interrupreted )
Proud of their language and identity these other people do n’t care much .
Yah(agree ) you just find one or two people speaking in their language but it 's so rare yah .
Mmmh .. Mmmh . ( agree ) how about those friends in school or in campus ?
Ok in school many people preffer speaking in English or Swahili yeah , so you know I do n’t know whether it 's because they are bragging(showing off ) or because they are used to it but some people say like ok you find some Luos do n’t want to speak in mother tongue you will find them saying that they know mother tongue but they cannot speak that they are not used to speaking it so you know me I wonder that where are you from but otherwise the people I work with mainly are mother tongue speakers so you know you will find us maybe speaking in mother tongue when we want to talk about somebody maybe passing and you know is not luo we just say ok " we are speaking Luo " say(interrupted )
Especially with your friend Laura ( both Laugh .
Yah(agree ) Laura so we want to like gossip something say that trouser that trouser we just " longno longno " (luo native langugae for Trouser ) but do n’t speak it Swahili or English coz maybe the person will get what you are saying so we avoid that yah .
Ok , so with your friends all those languages come in , mother tongue , Deluo , that is and English and Swahili .
Yah ( agree ) , but I really find a hard time speaking to people who are not Luo coz you know I am really really used to Luo so you know at times whe you seat like with people who are Kisii , or maybe kiuks(Kikuyu ) you know I will just be myself speaking in mother tongue and they will be you have said and I will be like(interrupted ) .
But your English is is good is pretty good I do n’t know about your Kiswahili if you are not speaking much of it now but I know your English is good .
Ok , I speak in English but you know what am used to is .. ahh mother toungue so you when we are maybe making . ok , this is official business .
It 's not official , this is not official really when you are in class but this one is not official .
Ok when we are in the hostel maybe watching a movie you know maybe someone is doing something and you what to explain just speak in mother tongue and then you will be you have said ok I have to translate and say " oooh sorry sorry " please I what I was saying ...
So it happened frequently ?
Yah ( agree ) a lot .
The Luo is soo much .
At list nowdays I am getting a hung of Swahili and English because at list I have been .
Because now that you are moved from deluo area you are aware that there are people who are not .. ( not clear ) the majority of the people are not frequently .
Yah ( agree ) I have got no option now .
Tell me you seem to think ok , you seem to be convinced that Deluo or your mother tongue is very important right ? How about English , do you think English is important ?
Yah ( agree ) English is equally important .
Equally important !
Ok , not really , Ok I do n’t like I would say preffer one language to the other coz I believe you are suppose to learn all the languages because mother tongue wil help me in my home are like in Kisumu , Nyanza ( names of town )
What is the importance of English ? Why is it important ?
Ok English is important because first of all if I want to get a job , I 'll have to speak in English or Swahili , and since I preffer English and since a preffer English I rather speak in English and again addressing very important issues , you know some issues cannot be just be addressed in any language in any manner all have .
Like the wadges .
Not wadges(both laughs )
Because you say , wadges when we are talking wadges you have to be in English , ok , important issues like ?
Importance issues like for example , I want to talk to a doctor , a teacher , a lecturer .
What if this doctor is Luo .
Ok , if he is Luo you know obviously the Luo part , ok even when you go to the hospital in Kisumu and the doctor is Luo you know first of all you will not speak in Luo you will first speak , ask you what 's wrong with you maybe after examining you will ask you something in mother tongue ask you where you come from mmh yah .
But do you find prombles for example descrbing that illness that you have in Deluo that you now have to say it in English .
Yah(agree ) at times you know you have some sot of sickness maybe the doctor was speaking in you in luo so you cannot really get but you can know it in English so I will have to translate .
And the reverse ?
Yah ( agree ) it also happens .
That sometimes you cannot expalin something in English if you use Luo .
Yah ( agree ) maybe something really personal and you just know from your Luo coz Luo will tell you " this is this , this is the disease " and you did n’t know it 's name so you will have to go there and say have been hearing people saying " it is this " so the doctor will always be recap and say " I know it too " .
Mmmh , so you think it 's important to know English .
Yah(agree ) a lot it is important to know English .
A part from getting a job and talking to , addressing serious issues in campus here .
But ok English is important because let me just say movies that we watch a lot in mother tougue yah , the placeses we hung out people do n’t speak in mother tougue , the music we listen , especially music , music I listen in English mostly .. ( interrupted )
But I love Luo music especially , they are very nice Tonny Nyandundo ( Luo Musician ) is soft .
Ok the Luo music is soft you know it 's kind of romantic but my prefference is RNBs .
RNBs ..
Yah(agree ) I preffer and most of them let or let me say all of them are in English .
Do you think we can have a Luo song done in RNB ?
Really , I do n’t think so , it is too slow they take too long like , one song can be in fifteen minutes will you be listening one song fifteen minutes really ?
like Tonny Nyandundo .
Aaah , no those are for big people let them listen .
like me I enjoy Tonny Nyandundo by the way it 's just .. ( interrupted )
You do n’t look Tonny Nyandundo fun , you do n’t , ok I mean do you really listen to the songs ? Do you hear to what the are saying ?
The problem I might not get that , but I have Luo friends to tell me this is but I just enjoy the beat and the way he sings , you know music sometimes it ’s not just about the message what he is talking about .
Maybe the beat .
Yah(agree ) the beat you are enjoing that . So you say English is very important is that your words ?
Yah(agree ) English is very important I believe everyone should know English yah , at list even if you have your mother tongue and another complementary language but English must be there yah .
Mmmh ( agree ) so you think you are in a better position than those people in your village ?
Off course am in a better position because …. ( interrupted ) .
what are the disadvantage in , there are living there are .. ( not clear )
Ok , there living there but you know lets say for example TV there are totally disadvantaged coz they did not hear what is been said maybe radio will favor them because they put there local stations .
But now days we have yah local stations like Ramogi , Ramogi Fm .
Yah ( agree ) they put there local stations that ’s only place that it will favor them , but even when you listen the radio station for example Ramogi , you will hear someone someone calling and speaking in English until the guy will be like " please speak in mother tongue , please speak in mother tongue " in fact this is there local station thats the only place that will favor them .
This a mother tongue station .
Yah(agree ) you know everyone is used to English you cannot say that it 's a Luo station everything is in Luo yah , no .
So are you saying that you can servive without a mother tongue but can n't servive without English
Yah ( agree ) I believe so unless .. ( interrupted )
You believe so . So do you think it 's important to know a mother tongue a native langugae .
Ok , it is important to know a native language but … (interrupted )
So the importance is it at part , English and mother tongue .
English is more important .
So mother tongue comes ?
After English yah .
why why is It important first to know a mother tongue .
To know a mother tongue I believe it 's good to keep up our culture our heritage at list you have a sence of belonging yah .
Like you , you telling me Luo that you respect Luo Luo Luo so much , so is that important to you ?
Yah ( agree ) it is ok ok , I do n’t really speak Luo because it is important to me but because am used to it yah , it 's been .. ( interrupted )
But you feel it 's important to know .
Yah ( agree ) it 's important to know , at list if someone asks you " are you a Luo ? I am a Luo . Tell me something in Luo ? " I 'll be like " ooh I 'll gladly do " yah will I can tell someone .
Have you made somebody who is a Luo but can n't speak ?
Yah ( agree ) a lot .
What do you feel about such people ?
I feel like , I do n’t know maybe they are bragging(showing off ) they do n’t want to be identified with Luos . Unless they hate the Luos .
Would you ever do that ? Even if you go to UK ( United Kingdom ) or US ( united States ) and meet on the streets and you like " it 's Deluo "
I , I , I …. ( In hesitance and not clear ) No no I will never do that it 's not worthy it why should I do that ? I can n't .
It 's your heritage it 's you .
Yah ( agree ) at list I feel like a have a sence of belonging at list if I go back to Kisumu obviously people will expect me to speak in Luo . You can n't expect me to go to United State for a year and come back and be like " why are you even saying that would be a lie " .
Mmmh(agree ) that would be a lie . But yah there are people who bragg(show off ) they know but they try to pretend that they do n’t know .
Off course they know .
But there those people also probably who are raised in town unfortunately they did n’t , the language spoken there was Swahili and English so they do n’t know the mother tongue
I believe they are in town that would be an excuse yah .
Mmmh , that 's an exucse .
Yah(agree )
The town that you have lived in is Kisumu .
Ok I have lived in Kisumu yah .
But she still .. ( both laugh ) ok honest am in Kisumu in the streets …. ( not clear )
Ok it 's true but .. ( interrupted )
Unless these are people who are not Luos speaking but mostly on the streets the language you will hear is ?
Am now giving a perfect situation where this person was raised in Nairobi not even that person maybe this person is your age the parents of that person were born in Nairobi ok , this is person who is just in Nairobi through and through .
Ok such a person aaah … (interrupted )
Do n’t you think they , they what problems do you think they will have by not knowing .. ( not clear ) it 's not there fault but .
They will not have much of problems but you know identifying with Luos will be hard .
Identity , yah so identity you feel is the .. ( not clear ) without an identity .
Yah(agree ) they will be asked " what tribe are you Luo you do n’t understand Luo you can n't speak it " you just look as you are intruding yah so I believe I do n’t believe ok if I were there really to struggle to learn at list something .
Yah coz nowdays that we have classes that is for mother tongue people can attend classes for mother tongue .
Would you attend mother tongue classes for Luo like you a Kalenjin will you attend for Luo ?
ow maybe motivation what will be the motivation what would be the motivation if I am somebody who is passionate about languagesis knowing language or I work in Kisumu I would want probably to do that yah but the problem is with our society it is always that English is the language that will take you places or French or French i would rather French than Luo . Is it the same for you ?
Mmmh ( agree )
That you would want to learn Kalenjin even you are given Kalenjin class and French class or German class which one .
Ok , I would n't go for Kalenjin because I believe Kalenjin will only help me in Kenya , but you know Kenya .. ok I will have that mentality if I learn French I can to a country like Paris and go there and maybe you are going to communicate with the people and but only kalenjin ... ( interrupted )
Another thing is I am a Kalenjin ok , you are a Luo we can comminucate still ok because even without English we have Swahili is that true but with a French man .. ( pause )
It 's only ( interrupted ) .
Yah you need to know the French so you feel the reason the reason why we select this languages yah .
It 's only the French .
So do you tend to mix languages you know Deluo , Swahili , English and Sheng(Slang ) which is not a langauge but yah do you tend to mix in one converstion ?
A lot .
A lot mmh .
Ok I really I really mix them coz ok you know I cannot stick in one fluent language until I finish it 's .. ( interrupted )
When do you mix .
Ok I really mix it especially when telling stories I talk a lot .
Telling who stories ?
My friends .
Like who ?
Especially like Laura I have another friend called Joyce and many I cannot named all of them .
So with them you mix .
Yah ( agree ) I mix a lot
So why why because am sure that friend of yours knows Kiswahili very for example or Deluo why not just mix Deluo ?
It 's hard .
Why ( both Laugh ) why mix ?
It 's hard to speak on language actually it 's very very hard
What makes you have that urge of mix .
Do n’t spice the story you know sometimes you want to like really drive a point home so you know you have to mix all the languages you know and everything you can talk about so she can really get the point like … (interrupted )
Is it like there are things that are best said in Luo and others best said in English do you find .. ( interrupted )
Totally yah there are some stories that like especially when you want to talk about something you really saw and really made you happy you have to speak it in Luo you know Swahili and English will not ok maybe you do n’t have the terms to use so you have to speak in Luo so that they can really get the point what you are driving home .
So if this person is a Luo you will mix the languages ?
Luo , Luo mostly especially English .
Luo and English , if this person is not Luo .
Slang , probably Slang
which is ?
Swahili , English .
Mmmh ( agree ) mixture of the two . So mostly you can even mix the three if it is Luo speaker you are talking to .
Ok it will be rare to mix .
It will be rare to mix it happens that its English and Luo .
Yah(agree ) English and Luo but .. ( interrupted )
No Swahili words fitting in from there ?
Ok it 's very hard ok me , me and Swahili is not very good friends Swahili is … (interrupted )
Is it something that is also in your ritual ?
Yah ( agree ) Swahili is a big problem a very big problem so you know … (interrupted )
So .. ( not clear ) that is the case ?
Ok my be I do n’t know the pronunciation of words maybe the terms are so hard like me Swahili ok personally Swahili is not my thing ok to , to be abided by tenseis very hard eeh yah .
To use correct tenses .
Yah(agree ) you know is not like English that you can just pick up any word from anywhere from your mind and just come in Swahili you have to follow grammer , I do n’t know check this word maybe you used wrongly .
You have to say chairs are broken .
Exactly and that is not what is and you know in Slang that is those chairs are broken that ’s wrong Swahili or …. ( not clear ) you know nobody will care you know the students saying " hey , by the way those chairs broke you know nobody will even realize you are speaking wrong Swahili it 's just normal .
So it 's not an attitude because sometime people feel it 's an attitude that …. ( not clear )
It 's not an attitude .
Luos .. ( not clear ) that , your Swahili is here , English is theirs so I want to squiz it and I am like ..
Ok it 's not an attitude and then Swahili and English I preffer English because at list my accent wo n't be much but Kiswahili when is speak my accent will be so heavy you know you will just feel my Luo mother tongue and " you will say that girl "
Are really Luos from Nyanza Kisumu mmmh .
I preffer English coz at list it can cover up my accent .
How about Slang it goes where English Swahili goes where ?
Ok it goes ( hesistance ) but you know Slang has also it 's words it not necessary book to be …. ( not clear ) It 's not some wearied wearied words who done what but am not fun of Slang a lot but I 'll mix Swahili and English but am not a fun of the Sheng coz .. ( interrupted )
But you can pick like somebody you know what they are talking about but sometimes you can also get lost because is this language .
Like when you get those boys or ladies who are really from the Ghetto down there and they are speaking you will be like " excuse me which language is that ? Is that Slang .
What do you mean ? if you say something you have to u ….. ( interrupted )
You cannot get what they are saying eeeh but this little by little like this of ours is Slang that we can understand .
Yah(agree ) this normal ones maybe picking also from radio programs or TV sessions .
This our local programs yah espeically the Tahidi high , the Inspecta Mwala the ones that are always in 7:30 from Monday to Fridays it ’s easy to pick up Slang coz they speak a lot .
Have you noticed the difference from the way you talk different with other students they way the talk .
Mmmh(agree ) ok you know the people we click are the people you talk like me and Laura I can say we click because we talk the same but ok .
What is this clicking thing ? Is it because you come from the same background ?
No the person am used to you I cannot just talking to any lady down coz some ladies when you listen to them talk the are showing of so while others we do n’t like that kind of thing . Me I would love people am free with I can talk with I can laugh with you can anything with so .. ( not clear ) ladies just talk and they are speaking influent English passes you until I say heeeh ! ok sawa but when you have a friend that you really understand one another you know you can talk about anything ... ( interrupted )
Does that affect yout attitude towards such people or affect the way you speak to them like would you .. ( interrupted )
Yah(agree ) of course it does yah it does … (interrupted )
Like would you maybe switch to English quickly … (interrupted
Of course when you meet a lady who is speaking fluent English always in English you know you cannot just go there and say who I dont know what you would have just to say like excuse me you have to make your words there … (interrupted )
And it will not be that Deluo English .
Aaah ! no not with that …. ( not clear ) ( both Laugh )
You will find yourself raising a little bit .
Yah so that he/she know at list am not a mother tongue speaker a full time even though you hear me speak a lot of mother tongue yah I 'll ask her I 'll to her in English fluent English yah .
So there is a difference like other students with ( interrupted )
Yah(agree ) You know obviously atitude also change towards them coz you will feel like they are always showing of these people show-off so I cannot work with such people these too will be like " heeeh ! these girls talks by showing off " even me I cannot work with such people . ( Interrupted )
So there is that is that group of so much English and there is this group of mother tounge , where do you fall ?
So much mother tounge .
So much mother tounge you fall there .
Yah(agree ) a lot .
Ok and there those who fall in the middle how do you find such ?
I think Laura falls in the because she does n’t speak a lot of mother tounge .
You know your friend well , because that is what she told you .
Yah(agree ) she falls in the middle coz she does n’t speak a lot of mother tounge but me I speak a lot of mother toungue .
But you are also helping her because she told you Deluo is not she start Deluo when she was really young so you are helping her also .
Yah ( agree ) nowwadays she is trying but when join she was not .. ( clear ) then even her accent was ahhh !! ( laugh )
Was out you must know this like a kid trying to learn another(Interrupted )
Exactly .
Ok , aaah , so when somebody talks , somebody is talking can you tell from what area they are coming from , from the way they are talking ? Some .
Yah(agree ) some , like I can tell Baluo(Luo ) I can tell from the Western side coz I have lived Western part of my life have lived in Western during the holidays I use to go and see my sister so you know I can tell this is a Lughya ( tribe ) the way the accent is so heavy and tell , especilly Nyanza ( place ) Nyanza , Nyanza ok , Nyanza people are so obviouse yah , the people from Pwani(place called Coast ) are obviouse coz they will always be like " sister I dont know what " they will be polite in a way and then .
You use Swahili more .
Yah(agree ) and then the Kisii(tribe ) are little but the people that really you cannot tell are Kikuyus(tribe ) kind of hard for me to tell because I do n’t know wheather it will be a Meru(tribe ) a Embu(tribe ) or what .
But , but you will know they are from that central region based on what ? How do you know .
Ok you look at their face ( both laugh ) ok there is a way their nose and their cheek borns are ok .. ( interrupted )
And is it consistand that much ?
Oh ! Not really but .. ( interrupted )
Not really but when somebody is a typical Kikuyu you will know mmh .
Yah ( agree ) and then the accent by the way the , the , the , ( hesistate ) there is some words that disturb them the letters like " RRR and LLLLL ) so when they say your name is Lolita , Rorita they say Rorita no Lolita so you will just know " this one "
Comes from there .
Comes really from there .
Ok , apart form accent from the way somebody if he/she has good accent can you say this person is from this region not , we are not talking about face eally but the way they speak even if they do n’t have that RRR Rorita thing .
It 's hard to tell , you cannot really tell where they are from especially when they are bred in town like most of them are from Nairobi you know I cannnot tell what tribe is coz they are speaking in Slang yah , you cannot really tell where they are from until you ask .
If there is Luo and they are speaking English without an accent and this is a Kalenjin speaking in English without an accent is it possible somehow .
No , it 's not if there is no accent ( interrupted )
Some people say , some people say Luos know how to speak a lot of English .
True , but you know if he/she does n't have an accent you cannot know at all like right now say a person who does n’t know me ok at list you know me you know I speak a lot of mother tongue Laura knows me but a total stranger comes and finds me really speaking like this ( not clear ) ( interrupted )
No , you know ok this a person we are looking a person coming here on campus for example and has a choice of Deluo , English and Swahili and there is another one who has a choice of Kalenjin English and Swahili . By the way languge they choose to speak in a nautral environment now not mother tonge can you tell a little bit about that .
Yah(agree ) like a Luo its easy to tell .
How ?
Yah , Luos like bragging you will just know a Luo .
Yes , that ’s what I want you to tell me , is it possible from the way they use language .
Mmmh(agree ) it is possible for a Luo may be other , other tribes I do n’t for a Luo I can just tell you .
You know there is a way you can tell somebody the way you own so many cars and without them asking and just the way of conversation is it ( interrupted ) .
Yah(agree ) it 's posible like a Luo will be bragging all the electronic gadget which he owns maybe a Kalenjin I do n’t know what they preffer but that ( interrupted ) .
Because somebody , somebody might not tell you I have a twenty I mean fourty inch TV you just say " aah , you know when I was watching that movie from my that fourty inch screen you know a way(sentence not well explained ) I am not probably doing that but is it , is that the case ?
Yah(agree ) it ’s the case for Luos , that ’s why people call , peeople think Luos are braggers a lot yah , because we are always bragging like " that my Iphone is broken , I even do n't know where to take , I want to sell my Laptop and buy another one " you know it 's like they are always just having fun of the resources .
They bring issues in convesation prettending that they do n’t feel but they are communicating something .
Yah(agree ) like " hey ! My father bought a Prado have you seen , I do n’t know what " you know such things you just this is a Luo really bragging yah .
Pretending to talk about Prado ( type of a car ) but actually what he wanted to say is that " my father bought a Prado " so it 's possble . How about because you mention face say when you see somebody facial features you can tell the region they come from . what if this person is speaking without you seeing them can you tell the area , the backround they came from .
Ok if am not seeing them ( interrupted ) .
Like for example radio , somebody is speaking on radio can n't see this person can you tell .
On radio if am not seeing them and there is an accent I can tell but if there is not accent and have n't told me the name I cannot tell that ’s going to be hard coz I 'll not .
How about topics they discus is it possible to … (interrupted )
Ok , topics they will discus , maybe they are discussing things that are affecting there areas you will really know this person really know about this area maybe he is from that side yah .
So you can aproximate , what if there is no information about the area .
I can n't tell unless am an anjel or something .
How about backround information like somebody 's level of education can you tell that this person " this was finished " high school or this one make it campus from what you are hearing or this one did n't go to school .
Obviously you know I always believe where you 've reach in education that is where you mind is as in lets say I reach high school you know even when you talk you stories will be based on " this high school you will always be concern with high school but right know when you are on campus you will always be concern about what is happening in campus what is going to happen when am out of campus so you know you will be thinking a head but when a person just reach high school you know just this is high school coz they do n't have a forward plan it rare ok am just ... ( interrupted )
They do n’t have a forward plan they just . ( interrupted )
Yah(agree ) they will be only just be circling in one area yah .
So you can easy tell .
Yah(agree ) you can tell this did n’t make to anywhere coz even ... ( interrupted )
Or this one is CEO can you tell somebody 's position in society this one is mananger this one who is talking in the radio or the one this one must be a farmer .
Yah(agree ) you can tell so long as the CEO will be talking about " my secretary does this for me , you know when am in a meeting , boardroom .. ( interrupted )
I mean even without mentioning that like this two people are talking Swahili or yah , this farmer is talking Swahili and this one is also can you tell the diffrence ?
Ok , it depend with the things they preffer like you the farmer will be talking about crops will be talking about milk .
Lets say a neutral topic .
I can n't tell .
You can n't tell ?
How , how would you tell ?
From words of vocabulary , we would think that because a manager is somebody who is well read so there will be no more vocabulary than … (interrupted )
It 's possible ok , maybe his choice of words maybe his diction will be nice but that of farmer will just be using this Swahili of mine it 's hard it would be easy to tell ok this guy it seems he/she not educated but the guy that is using Swahili maybe very hard terms this guy has reached far .
How about things like political affiliation like this guy must belong to even without mentioning that am ODM(political party ) or I am PNU(political party ) what is this other one the one that rules , JUBILEE can you tell that this person is most likely .
Maybe is they supporting they government you know obviously right now all Jubillee members will be supporting the government what the government does even if they do n’t what they will support but obviously if it was opposition person you will be hearing a little bit of negativity we talking of " this was not not right , this was not done right but they will not like " I do n't love to be ... ( not clear ) they will be .. you will just feel like there is a resentment towards the government . ( interrupted )
Yah ( agree ) towards the government and then you will just know this one … mmmh ! ( interrupted )
This is a person of .. ( not clear ) very much .
From the way they are expressing an issue . So what you are telling me is that language used can tell you more about somebody when they use langauge the use with the language they choose the way they use it is it exactly what you saying .
Ok yah , it can be use but not aspects yah , like on radio for example the examples I have given maybe on radio it can tell you maybe the person that that came talk to have a topic for discusion you can tell but not everything about the person
So you yourself do you speak different languages to different people maybe we talk about this befor just remind just remind me . Do you speak different languages with different people ?
Yah ( agree )
when for example ?
So I talked about my friendsi talk to them , ok them I use all languages class I will use English maybe if , ok all almost lectures I speak in English but maybe expect one lecture maybe be it rare to find me speaking in one fluent language unless it 's really amust which in most cases it 's not .
So lets pick your friends for example you are speaking to your friends in class which language ?
Swahili and English .
Or English , in the hostel .
Hostel .
This is Laura we are talking about .
Mother tongue .
Mother tongue in the hostel . Aaah ! Mmmh , anyother people .
OK but … (interrupted )
Like you are at home your parents .
My parents I speak with them in Deluo obviously , my mum even if you speak to her in English the next second she will speaking to you in mother tongue so it 's rather you speak in Luo .
Ok , so what determins this like , the choice of language with different people .
Yah , with what you preffer .
Preffer yourself .
Yah(agree ) with them also , you know obviously before you with someone you have to listen to what they really love like you will be listening the language which you like using so like Laura she speaks a lot of Swahili and English but mainly English so I know obviously I would love also , I 'll also love the Swahili and English because now that is what she preffers mmh .
Ok , and have you ever in your life try to change the way you speak ?
Yes , and it went so hay wire .
Hay wire was that ?… (not clear )
Ok , I was in school , I was in high school and then I found when I had gone for suspension because I was speaking a lot of mother toungue , so when I came back they I have a knew resolution so I was like ok from now onwards bacause Swahili I can n't make so I said from now onwards I will speaking to everyone in English so everywhere I was walking I was speakig English , English , English and everyone , feedback came " Loreta you showeing off , Loreta you are showing off nowadays "
You have started to show-off nowadays did it have something to do with , what were you suspended , can you tell me why you were suspended .
I was suspended for speaking mother toungue
Oooh ! So when you came back you will know what to .. ( interrupted )
I wanted to at list , because it was like everywhere .. ( interrupted )
So it was like a forced thing to do
Ok , it was a forced thing I was trying to change but it did n’t go well coz now everywhere I went nobody want to speak to you because you are just speaking in English untill I had to stop I left it I said no it 's not a must .
And the risk of suspension again , you are in back in your Deluo .
No , now I was avoiding talking , you know l 'll talk a lot and you know the more you talk a lot the more prone Luo you are so even I was avoiding people that will make speak mother toungue coz my name was written at around 4.55 AM morning meaning that ’s preps time in the morning at five in the morning so meaning probably that is time when I am going to class .
You wake up in the morning ( interrupted )
Honestly I think I just meet someone and said , maybe I just said something like " today am tired " and maybe preffect was passing because it was for 4:50 AM I do n’t see how I can do mother toungue right now . ( both laugh )
So any other incidence apart from that one that was forced on you because of suspension any other time you have tried to change .
Ok , have tried a new language have tried French in high school , the French was nice , form 1 , form 2 was nice but when it reached form 3 it was kind of hard and I had to say no no no I can n't
But like English or Deluo the language that you already know then there is away you speak it like you said " Laura has some accent that she tries to speak Luo but he had an accent . Have you tried to change the way you speak like Luo .
No I have never tried why should I ?
So when it is the Luo you speak at home is the same Luo you speak to people here .
Yah(agree ) it 's the same way coz that ’s what have been tought but you know once in a while you get a new vocabulary and you will have to fill it in .
And am not just talking about vocabulary am talking about because I think there is , you talked about " wenging " (show of ) there is a possibility of wenging(show of ) in Luo .
No mother toungue you cannot … (not clear ) ok there is only , there is this Luo from Alego(place ) that it is very intresting the way the talk it 's very nice but you know if you are not from that side it ’s just , it 's like British English you know if you are not British you cannot just speak it so there are levels .... ( interrupted )
But have you tried to … to imitate it have you ever tried or there is no reason to do that .
Have tried but not all the time because you will forget you know them it 's part of them but for you , you will forget like I have tried a couple of time but it does n’t work out .
How about English .
English have tried " wenging ' maybe just amongst my friends just to brag .
This braging thing so you also try sometimes .
Maybe you meet in town and you are all friends you know sometimes it 's just good yah , from campus and want them to speak mother toungue you know you speak in English and they know you are learned .
Would it be like you want to fit , be like some people .
No , not really just to . ( interrupted )
Because there is this group have been in campus also and I know there is this we use to call them " us guys " we are that category of people .
Ok , no in campus have never not really wanted to fit in any group but have just wanted to just brag just to show off a little bit ok like when I joined . ( interrupted )
Even though you people think am . so Luo am also ... ( interrupted )
Like when I joined back in October everyone was like " aaii ! You speak a lot of mother tongue and you do n’t look like it " so I had to like keep up with abit of English so that they can know at list I know English or something so people look at you people judge you by the way you dress , by the way you look so they will be like " you like this , you speak a lot of Luo what 's wrong with you am like sorry I will start speaking in English then so that you believe that I know English .
How about because I know you are studing media science do you feel a pressure like " you know that I am in media science I need to change the way I am talking .
Yah(agree ) you know coz when you go to the studio there is this guy we called him Gilly he is always like practice English practice your Swahili read newpapers and that is not what I really do so you know you should be like you will have stop mother tongue coz when I want to represent in English or Swahili it 's a challege for me coz I really love mother tongue so . ( interrupted )
You wish you were given a chance to present in mother tongue what . ( interrupted )
Ok mother tongue I cannot present in mother tongue again .
Why ?
Ok , for me like if you know Okelo him he can present in mother tongue but me I can n't coz I do n’t have the accent , first they will hear the accent they will have to know what words you know in mother tongue but you know those words they use in the radio sations I wonder if you listen radio sation I do n't really hear all of them coz they are very hard .
Even though you think you are native and fluent speaker of … (not clear ) you are a fluent speaker of …
I am a fluent speaker I can speak fluently for long but not deep words but shallowing here but for English you know I want to present in English coz at list English my vocabulary is good my diction is good my choice of words is very nice .
It 's already good so you do n’t feel the need to change or sometimes you feel " aaii that girl her diction must be " so I also want to try and ... ( interrupted )
Ok , at times you feel that way but not always .
You feel you can get by with your own you can servive with your own English .
Ok , I believe my English is good so I do n’t really preffer to be like someone else or something .
You just said that you do n’t read newpapers with you are not into new paper , you not into news papers a lot and new are you into news ?
Am into news coz at list that I will take my time to watch and do not really focus you know can just watch news and know this what it 's happening but for news papers you will have to read you will have to take story from this page and as per now my course is forcing me to really try and get into news paper coz that 's what am going to .
Anything that ’s a problem because of our education system the way you probably just choose a course without , do n’t you think sometimes it ’s good to have that passion … (not clear have always love news , do n’t you think it 's natural for that person to go in to media ?
Yah(agree ) , for that person it 's nice from now all she/he has to work on is just the technical part of it and maybe to pass her grades but for person I want to take law personally yah , but now am in media science I have to keep up with people who .. ( interrupted )
Did you find yourself in media ?
Ok media science it was a bit cheaper than law , law you know it 's a very expensive so that ’s so I had to go something .. ( interrupted )
Because of cost .
Yah , cost so I had to go to something that at list it 's good too but somewhere there .
So it was not your first choice .
No , it was not never .
What issues do you discuss with your friends ( both laughs ) like what topics for example do you .
Ok , mainly we talk about fashion .. ( interrupted )
Am like you have some really nice bangle .
Ok , mainly we talk about fashion , we talk about men we cannot lie , we talk about men we talk about love we talk about very little issues but main thing is always boys , boys boys yah .

Yah ( agree ) and then we like sittting in a places where people passes so you can say " that girl is smart yah , have you seen those shoes ? where did you buy these shoes " ok that is what ladies discuss mainly gossiping a little yah , but also ... ( interrupted )

Maybe you are not interms with someone you know like ladies you did n’t study then … (not clear ) you will be telling someone " that girl bothers me even when she does something let me talk about it and stuff .
Other topics like ?
Ok , maybe ok , it depends with the environment like if you are in class if you are in the library you will keep to track but if you are (( interrupted ) .
Although Laura told me something that you people where in the library I do n’t know when and you were talking about holiday going into Lamu I do n’t know going where .
Maybe she was with Slyvia but not me ok you know mmh ! first I can say the things we discus come with how you are like for example you know ladies talk about things they way they just happen not like I just sit and say am going today to talk about this and that maybe Facebook hey ! have you read this story thats what we discuss yah and then we talk about ... ( interrupted )

Am on Facebook , twitter am not an active member I also email a lot yah maily it always Facebook so you know it will be like " look at this thing posted on Facebook , look at this thing posted on Facebook then we talk about it for hours and hours and then again something passes again ... ( not clear ) you can miss something to talk about yah we will always be talking and talking and talking maybe I dont know thats why maybe people find you talkative and then people say am loud so I am use to it .
Why always this issues of relationship and Facebook .. ( interrupted )
Ok , ladies are fragile you know this is a fragile this .. ( interrupted )
Passion why , why those specific topic politics economy , you know economy is doing bad in this days .
Ok , you know we just talk about things that intrest us you know you can talk about something that and then I talk about things that you now much about I cannot talk about politics and economics and especially I do n’t no nothing about economics and politics why should I discus about politicians yet I know like a heart full of them so I 'll rather talk about things I am aware .
