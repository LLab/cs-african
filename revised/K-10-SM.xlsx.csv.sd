Welcome to today 's eeh , conversation .
Tha : nk you !
Eeh , these questions want us to know how people use language kila siku [ uncertain transcription ] ukitumia language ukiwa nyumbani , ukiwa kwa job , na watu wenye unatumia lugha nao .
Naam .
Saa , wewe utumia lugha gani nyumbani , na wazazi . Family wazazi , brothers , sisters ?
Aa , when it comes to : my siblings , we use Kiswahili-Kizungu .
Kiswahili-Kizungu ?
Eeh . Kiswahili unachanganya Kizungu , hauenda sarufi sio yenye sahihi . Then when it comes to : my parents , eeh , mama anashida na Kiswahili , baba anashida na Kiswahili . So you either choose to speak in English or mother tongue . Ikifika kwa mother tongue , I can use Kimeru or Kikuyu .
Mmh hhm .
Yes .
Mmm . Na marafiki je ?
Marafiki , kama ni : classmates wangu , those ones it comes automatically that I speak Kiswahili now that I 'm a Kiswahili student . But outside the class context ni Kiswahili-Kizungu bado .
Kiswahili-Kizungu ?
Eeh .
Okay , na ni marafiki wa hapa shuleni na wa nyumbani ? Sababu kuna marafiki wa shuleni-
Wa shuleni .
Marafiki wa nyumbani .
Eeh . Sasa isipokuwa darasani , kwingineko ni : Kiswahili kidogo . I hardly use eeh , mother tongue with friends .
Okay .
Bearing in mind that si kila mtu anaweza akaongea Kikuyu , si kila mtu anaweza akazungumza Kimeru . Lakini : in general , we can speak Kiswahili . Na si Kiswahili sanifu ama Kiswahili throughout ama English throughout . Unachanganya tu , si Sheng , si Engs , si-haina jina .
Okay . Na : do you think it 's important kujua English ?
Yes .
Mmh . Why ?
Eeh , for various reasons . Kwa mfano mimi ni mwanafunzi . Hapa shuleni most of-ah-now that I 'm a Kiswahili student , most of my courses are in Kiswahili . But there are others , which we are taught and examined in Kiswahili . So in the first place as a student I should know Kiswahili . Halafu natazania baada ya masomo , nijiunge na wanahabari . So it 's good to be diverse , as much as I 'm majoring in Kiswahili , I also need the English . And then there is a probability of travelling in countries which do no use Kiswahili , and they do n't use any of the mother tongues that I speak . So Kiswahili is still-I mean English is needed .
Okay , so the motivation fo : r , kujua English is because of the benefits you get from the language ?
Yes .
Ok .
Apart from ile fact ya nilizaliwa ikawa it 's a compulsary subject . Now if I want to choose-whe-if to learn English , now those are the factors that would motivate me . Kazi , unaweza ukapata kwenye Kizungu kinahitajika . Exams , and for travelling purposes .
Ok . What about in school ? Sasa kama formal settings , kama hapa sasa campus , unatumia lugha gani ? [ uncertain transcription ] kwa darasa mkiwa na lecturers na students ? Hivo .
Ninety-nine percent of my official time in school I use Kiswahili .
Ninety-nine percent .
Ninety-nine percent . Sasa wakati niko : mahali kama kanisani , because I 'm also a leader in church , that 's where I speak English . Nikiongea Kiswahili ni ya kutisha tu kidogo .
( giggles ) Okay . Na unafikiria ni important kujua native language ?
Yes , it 's a : important in some way . Eeh , but if allowed to : - nisie-nisichague side yakusema-yaku support . First it 's important because ukitembelea sasa kama our grandmothers , hawajui Kiswahili , hawajui Kiingereza . Sasa if you do n't speak in your native language hamtaelewana . And then , there 's aah .. for purposes of research , unaweza ukapelekwa mahali kama- if I 'm a Luo I could end up being taken in a Luo set up , to do some research . Okay , siko sure na about the Luo but I 'm very sure in the Swahili culture , they hide so much information if you do n't belong to them . Ukiuliza mambo ya nyumbani , " ungekuwa wetu tungekwambia lakini sasa haturuhusiwi " so , but if-if I take that in the Luo set up for example and I go to do some research there na niongee Kijaluo , hata wewe kama Mluo mwenzangu you 'll feel confident to share the information plus tunaongea lugha moja so haitakuwa hata ngumu . Ile kuongea . And then on the : side of it where I would also think si lazima sa : na watu waongee their native language , is on tribalism .
Okay .
Cuz tunaenda : -kwa mfano unaenda sokoni kwamtush , mtumba . Una : - if I 'm a Kikuyu I 'm selling the mitumbas and [ uncertain transcription]-and you 're-we ni Mkikuyu mwenzangu , huenda hata nikakupunguzia bei . So if I-if another person from a different tribe gets to learn about it , si kuna hizo feelings za " eh , sasa huyu ameuzia huyu mwingine fifty [ uncertain transcription ] mimi akaniuzia a hundred , just because I 'm not a Kikuyu . If you go in government offices , na some-some NGOs unapewa kazi kulingana na , aah the tribal basis , especially ukiongea lugha yako kama- let 's say umeenda mahali na hujui hata who to talk to . Halafu usikie kuna ofisa mmoja hapo ameongea let 's say in Kalenjin , na wewe ni Mkale . So ukifika hapo , you speak in Kalenjin and things become easier . And finally we have been aah , saving in those feelings mpaka sasa zikaanza kuleta mambo kama the post-election violence . But if it was uniformed , if I 'd come to you I speak to you in Kiswahili , or English , or another national language , I 'm sure ingepungua , hii tribalism . Because language is one of the major integral parts constituting to tribalism .
Mmm . Do you think language promotes culture ?
... Eeh , yes . Because language is part of culture . You will never study a : certain culture without involving their language . Kwa mfano huwezi kuongea kuhusu the Masaai culture , bila : ku- without talking about the Masai language . Ama huwezi sema utamaduni wako ni wa Mmeru like personally I-I 'm a Meru . I can n't come telling you I 'm a Meru , meaning I share the Meru culture and I-I can n't even speak the Kimeru . It 's part of it , I think . Yea .
Do you think , the way we-we : -we speak some of these languages from the Western culture like English . English is from the West .
Yes ?
Do you think as a result of that , that is why we have issues that were never there in the past kama gayism , lesbians and such like things . Do you think it 's because we-now that you said a language is part of culture . In order to speak their language , we 've also borrowed-it 's like we 've borrowed their culture .
Aah , culture is very wide . Nilisema : language is part of the wide culture . So it does not necessarily mean that- kwasababu I 'm speaking in Spanish , I have to be 100% of the Spa- of the Spanish culture . Naweza nikachukua tu ile language from the motivational factors that I mentioned in English because of my own reasons as such . Lakini ikiwa hawa-hawavai vile ningependa kuvaa , you know even dress code is part of the culture , I do n't have to borrow that I can just borrow the language . Kama sipendi chakula ambacho wanakula -for example you can learn Chinese but you do n't like the , eeh Chinese cuisine . So : sifikiri language ndio imetufanya tuombe the Western culture . I think each bit of the culture comes on it 's own . If it 's dress code , you borrow the dress code . If it 's the eating habits , you borrow the eating habits . If relationships-yea , but language comes now as one of the many factors that make the culture .
Okay . It 's evident that you mix languages in your conversation .
Yea .
Why do you do that ? And generally most [ uncertain transcription ] do that . Why do you think we mix languages , when talking ?
Why we mix languages when talking ? Yea , like-
What you call codeswitching .
Yes . Like me apart from when it 's in the exams , I-you hardly speak a whole paragraph ya English ama Kiswahili . First , as a Kiswahili student , so many Kenyans ait Kiswahili sio lugha ya rahisi . So if I were to speak to you Kiswahili , eeh na si eti najua Kiswahili : as in : to the very high levels . You should listen to my lecturers speaking . If I speak Kiswahili like continuously- nilitangulia kwa kukwambia in church , especially when I 'm leading the service here in school , I introduce myself in Kiswahili , ile tu ya kutisha ( smiling ) . Cuz it 's not many people who will want to speak the Kiswahili as in fluently : , and that is why , eeh-like me , I do it in the class context . If you 're my classmate we can speak a whole day in Kiswahili and you do n't even realize . But then when I come to you in another area , ah ! tunachanganyachanganya tu . To make communication easier and uuh , yea . To make it even fun .
Mmm . Which languages do you tend to mix ?
Mostly English and Kiswahili .
Mmm .
Yes .
No Sheng , mother tongue ?
I hardly use , eeh , mother tongue , unless it 's in special , eeh , context . But if in my daily , as in normal living , I do n't even realize nimechanganya Kiswahili na English . We 'll talk " eh , umeenda room ? " So umeenda is Kiswahili , room is English , yea .
So it 's like it has become part of you . It 's unconscious .
Yes , you do n't even realize .
Okay . And eh , have you noticed a difference vile we unaongea na vile friend yako anaongea ?
Yea .
And other people generally . Do you think there 's a difference , in the way { sisi tunaongea } -
{ Between the way I talk } na vile wengine huongea ?
Mmm .
Eeh , first for those who hate Kiswahili so much , and uuh , claim that Kiswahili is hard , they will never speak Kiswahili . I love Kiswahili so : if I 'm with a person who is in the same page with me , we will speak Kiswahili . But most of my friends do n’t . They cling on to English . And even that English , they do n't talk it the way I 'm talking . Okay you 'll get the same meaning but you know there 's the [ uncertain transcription : " wenging ? " ] part of it , there 's the : -ah- intonations , you know , the [ uncertain transcription : " wenging " ] . Yes . That one is very different . Then when it comes to Kiswahili it 's different . And then for me , I can n't say I do speak Sheng . I hardly . There 's this course we did aah " Kenya 's Linguistic Landscape " where we are taught about the origin and the development and all those things about Sheng . I think that was the time I realized I do n't know how to speak Sheng . I thought Sheng was mixing English and Kiswahili , which I do . But it 's not . Soo , what I do is I speak Kiswahili , I speak English . I can mix the two but when I 'm speaking my mother tongue I do n't mix unless I have forgotten what some-that thing , uhm want to refer to is called in my mother tongue . Now that one I can use Kiswahili or sh-English . But if I know the : -okay , what I want to say , I do n't mix , wu-aah-languages when I 'm speaking in my native languages . In Kiswahili and English I 'll mix which is also different from how other people mix . Yes . And then if it 's English just simple , then my Kiswahili could be a bit hard on you . If I want to , scare you I will ( giggles ) .
Okay . And eh , just going back a bit , back at home , what language do your parents tend to encourage you to speak ?
You see when , eeh , when I was very very young we were told-we used to-to live in Meru . It 's a rural place . So when we came to Nanyuki , where we live up to date , I could n't communicate with the rest of my agemates , you know if they are kids . Now hata nini- what is it called , mitihani shule ilikuwa ngumu because it 's examined in English I can n't speak a word in English . I can n't speak a word in Kiswahili , all I know is Kimeru . So , from there we were discouraged . If you want to be heard , if you want to make your needs known to my parents speak in English or Kiswahili . So we picked-we picked from there . We speak Kiswahili . My dad can even give me a call right now and we speak in English from the very beginning to the end . Eeh , like the way I 'm studying Kiswahili it 's-okay it has never dawned on them that I 'm actually taking Kiswahili , pure Kiswahili . So , they do n't speak Kiswahili . Unless they encourage you to speak the native language you can use Kikuyu or Kimeru or English . Kiswahili in my family is very discouraged . Yes .
Oo , and you 're taking Kiswahili , what 's the motivation then because you 're telling me in your childhood there was no Kiswahili anywhere-
Yes , there was no Kiswahili-
Your parents are not for it , what was the motivation ?
Actually my parents assisted me in uh , selecting hospitality and hotel management . So I was called in university town campus , and then it took me two months to change to main campus for Kiswahili . You sit in class and you get nothing . ( giggles ) . Yes . My motivation number one , I love Kiswahili . Since eeh , I loved Kiswahili in class around six . You know the way unaandika [ uncertain transcription ] unapata ten , out of forty . Unaandika ingine , five , andika ingine , twenty . So this day , I wrote an [ uncertain transcription ] and I got twenty-eight . And the first , I was the first girl with twenty-eight . Then the first boy had thirty . That was the highest mark , tangia class one hadi class six . Twenty-eight ilikuwa the highest marks nilikuwa nimewahi pata and the teacher motivated me and trust you me , since then , nimekwambia twenty-eight was the highest mark I had gotten , up to class six . Up to now that is the least , I have ever gotten . Twenty-eight was the least , from that point . Yea , so I love the language-
And the teacher had a-a part-{the teacher played a part }
{ And the teacher played } a big role in my love for Kiswahili .
Now you 've told me you 're doing Kiswahili and I 've just heard you talk about a ti-a course and the title is in English . Why is the title in English , why do you think-and I 've seen it , these people who do-people who do Kiswahili but your courses are in English [ uncertain transcription ]
Ah , imeandikwa kwa : Kiswahili ? I think , that one is changing . Because if you go to the department utaona : the forms zimeandikwa in English . So that for the understanding of everyone . If you are planning to take a course in our department you will find it pinned on the door in English . But for us , even the exam itaandikwa " sanaa za maonyesho katika kiswahili " that is " theater arts " in Kiswahili . And we are taught in Kiswahili and examined in Kiswahili . Yea .
Oh soo : it 's something that is changing .
Yes . We complained a lot because-okay in the beginning , actually it 's those people who studied Kiswahili like ten to five years ago . They used to be taught Kiswahili in English . But nowadays we are taught Kiswahili in Kiswahili . I have five courses , pure Kiswahili . The titles are Swahili , you are taught in Kiswahili you are examined in Kiswahili .
What do you think was the reason back then ? Does it mean Kiswahili back then did n't have vocabulary or did n't have experts to teach the [ uncertain transcription]-
No , the experts have always been there , since Kiswahili began . But up to date , let alone the ten gone years . Up to date Kiswahili has not been fully accepted . Kiswahili is viewed as aah , a language of those who are not learned . And that is why we were being discouraged that some of us ah Kiswahili students , we speak so much Kiswahili here then when we go to the uuh , shags , kwa akina grana , grandpa we speak in English to show them how learned we are ( laughs ) . That says one on one that if I speak Kiswahili to them , they wo n't see the sense of I 'm being in uh-
In campus .
In campus .
Okay . And can you tell that somebody is from your area from the way he or she talks . Generally , not really from your area but a native language . { If somebody talks you " this one comes from " }-
{ A certain native language you mean ? }
" Mmh , this one comes from this area , this one " -can you be able to tell ?
In some cases you can .
Using ?
Eeh , the most prominent one I think is the accent . Like if a Meru speaks I will tell you this is a Meru . From the accent , and they have a habit of , eeh , kudondosha . How would we call that in English , like removing the ' nd'-the ' n ' before the ' d ' , where it 's supposed to be , and adding ' m ' before the ' b ' . Like if you 're " baba yangu " I can call you " mbamba yangu " ( interviewer makes an amused sound in the background ) . Now that one I 'll know , definitely I can locate where that person comes from .
Okay .
When you : look at people like uuh , those who come from the Luo land , the accent is very sharp . If uuh , the Kikuyus . So in some cases you can tell especially because of the accent .
Okay . Apart from the accent , is there any other thing ? Kuna kitu ingine ambayo itakusaidia ujue huyu anatoka huku , apart from the accent ?
Apart from the accent ?
Mmm .
These aah , the rest are stereotypes .
Mmm . Okay , so it 's=
The : -your stereotypes , the way people have been stereotyped ah , " this is how Luos speak " you know if you hear someone bragging so much in our communication , that 's a Luo . Yea , so it might not be true .
Okay .
Yes .
Na : ukiwa na mtu-ukisikia mtu anaongea na hujamuona , maybe you 're outside there , and somebody is inside here na anaongea , unaweza tell level ya education , position yao in society , status yake ? Is he from a wealthy place ? Is he from a [ uncertain transcription ] place ? Can you be able to tell ?
Now that one depends on uuh , maybe the choice of words . Okay it does n’t matter whether if the person is using Kiswahili ama English . Lakini according to the choice of words definitely I 'll get to know your 'e from a wealthy background , depending on the words you 're choosing " can you call my driver to come pick me up from this place , my car has broke down " " I will send a driver with my Mercedes " you know that is not a poor person . But you 'll-from the same conversation someone else will talk of " I do n't even know what I will eat today " , " It 's the third day most probably I 'll sleep hungry " , you can tell . If someone else is comfortable and another one is not from the way they use their words vile wanaongea you can tell the-where someone comes from . Even uuh , apart from economic status , you can also tell if someone is a doctor . Okay , it might not be true but you can be around 90% correct . From the way they speak . Definitely you will speak about what surrounds your life . Kama unaishi hospitali you 'll hardly remember there 's a [ uncertain transcription ] . So if you 're like " eh , leo nimepata wagonjwa wengi " , sijui " there 's this kind of a disease " , that one is either a nurse or a doctor . And then someone else will speak of " tuligoma last time na hata this time bado tunagoma " those are people from education ( they both laugh ) . Yes .
Okay . And do you speak different languages to different people ?
Eeh , somehow . Let me say somehow . If you 're a Kikuyu I 'll speak to you in Kikuyu . If it 's-if the context allows , I 'll speak to you in Kikuyu . If you 're a : Meru I 'll speak to you in Meru . I know some bit of Luya so if you 're a Luya I can speak to you in Kiluya , and then 90% of the people I ask to guess where they think I come from , people guess I 'm a Swahili from the coast . So : if I come to you I can also speak to you in Kiswahili and I will actually convince you I 'm from the coast . If it 's a Luo , I can speak you know zile tu za salamu kidogo kidogo ? Yes .
Mmh , it seems then you have a passion for languages .
Yes . I do . After my degree I want to take a degree in ah , Spanish .
Spanish .
Yes .
Okay , the fact that you know Kikuyu to a large extent is because of Nanyuki ?
Yes and in Nanyuki there are many of them .
Okay .
And then my father is from the Meru side , my mother is from-
Kikuyu .
The Kikuyu side .
Mmm . Okay . Have you ever tried to change , vile unaongea ?
To change-
Your style of speaking . You know kilamtu ako na style , ya ku speak ?
Swag .
Yea swag ? What you call swag . Kila mtu ako na swag yake . Kusha ijaribu ku change ? Maybe ulikuwa influenced na a celeb . Huona vile celeb anaongea , ama yule lecturer wako anaongea , kama vile mwalimu anaongea , ama vile best wako anaongea . Ama maybe sikumoja uliambiwa " aah wewe hata sipendi vile unaongea ' Ushawahi jaribu ku change regardless of .. the-the what pushed you to-
No , for me , like the ka history I have given you , you realize I was very clueless in languages . ( laughs ) So I have been imitating my role models . But not in their style , not really style of speaking . I can borrow words from you . Eeh , if I did n’t know what a table is called in Kiswahili and you mention it-like in class our lecturers have really big terms . So what they mostly do , the-when dictating notes they will talk of aah , meza , maybe do n't know what meza is then into brackets wakwambie " weka table " , so from then , you 'll get to know that " Okay , I used to switch codes when-if I 'm speaking in English and I want to say table which I do n't know whether it 's table , naiita meza " . So from that point you get to know it 's a table . But ile style-style as in your way of talking , unless when I 'm making a joke and I 'm imitating these celebs like I like uuh , Rashid Abdalah . He 's a journalist in uh , QFM and QTV . Eeh , who is- okay I do n't use their style to talk . Vile naongea ndivo tu nimekuwa nikiongea , English , Kiswahili . But when it comes to : copying , not copying to speak as [ uncertain transcription ] , I copy to imitate and make fun and maybe repeat what you said . Yes .
Okay , what are some of the issues . Ni nini siku hizi mnaongea saana tunaweza sema mushenee , ama-
Kasheshe-
Eeh , hiyo kasheshe basi . Yea , the kasheshe with friends nowadays ? { Ladyfriends , let 's start with ladyfriends , yes } Yes , those ones .
{ The four-one-ones}(giggles ) Definitely relationships are there and have always been there .
Okay .
Utachukua huyu mwanaume unamchambua , unamchambua kutoka kichwa hadi miguu unaenda kwa tabia ( both giggle )
Okay .
Then from there ladies and fashion are inseperable . Mnaende kutoka hairstyles . Mnaenda kwa make-ups , ni zipi latest , eh ? Kwa : kwa nguo , ni gani zinashika watu sana ? The trousers , there was a time these pencil trousers zilikuwa zinakunjwa from inside pale chini , nowadays zinapunjwa , juu . ( laughter )
Okay . Sija notice hiyo .
Then there was a time windbreakers become so : fashioanable kunanyesha lakini mpaka nivae windbreakers siwezi vaa jacket . ( both laugh )
Okay .
Eeh , so : fashion , relationships , and aah , a small percentage of it , what next after here .
What next ?
Yes .
Why do you think you talk like that ? About those issues ?
About eh , kina fashions ? -
Kina fashions , kina ma relationships ?
Fo : r relationships , eh , we all want to get married . At least the larger part of my friends .
Okay .
So tunaanza kutambuana hapa . You know , like in high school someone told me that you 're usually carried away by emotions .
Mmm .
Ukiwa na mtu " aah this dude nim[uncertain transcript ] " hata tabia zake huzijui . ( they both laugh ) . But you wo n't study that chemistry because ulienda funky fulani ukakutana na the tall , dark and handsome , eh ? But now when we are here that 's when you realize you 're getting old . After campus you will get a job . You : will settle with life . So what next , you 'll need a man . And if you 're planning to get married in two years , you do n't start looking for a boyfriend on that Saturday you want to get married . So unaanza na tabia . " Okay , this one is tall , dark and handsome lakini ni mchoyo " . Would you want to live with a mean person in the house ? This other one is not dark , tall and handsome as I would want but he is gentle , he is caring , he is loving so you choose , utafuata the looks ama utafuata { the character ? }
{ Character } Okay .
So hiyo topic haiwezi isha . ( they both laugh )
Okay . What about male friends ? Now just sometimes nikama issues zenye tuongea na males , sometimes ni different from zenye tunaongea na females . Sasa male friends ?
Male friends wangu ?
Mmm .
Mark you , I started interacting with men here in campus after being in girls ' schools all that long eh ? ( Both giggle )
Okay .
So males schools personally , huwa tunaongea mambo kama ya job . You know there 's this gender based issue , especially in my class we really argue- tukianza topic ya gender , jiokoe tu uende ( laughter ) . You know these jobs " eeh , Ann wewe utaolewa , ah wewe Matthew uta-utapata kazi . " So mostly it 's on aah , jobs , and then feminism . Tangu nisome hii kosi inaitwa jinsia na wana , that is sex and gender , hee ! You wo n't tell me eti kuna kitu mwanaume anaweza fanya mimi mwanamke siwezi fanya . Nijaribu nikishindwa sawa . Kama nitaweza , basi . Endesha . I can even perform it better than you can , woe unto you cuz I wo n't give you peace .
So it seems these things about male female what you can do , what you can n't do ni constructs za society tu . Ni society imetuekea .
Eeh . Inakwambia huwezi ukafika university . You know like in some communities , wasichana hawasomeshwi cuz it 's boys who are brighter and girls are foolish . But we have , tumekiuka hizo kanuni by we ourselves being in university in the first place . So how do you tell me that I can n't become a lecturer . Kwanza ukiniambia siwezi nikakua lecturer sasa hapo ndipo tutapambana kabisa . I would end up changing my goal set just to show you , naweza kuwa lecturer . Eeh .
So what 's your opinion about Sheng ? What do you think about Sheng ? Ukiulizwa useme ubaya wa Sheng ? Uzuri wa Sheng , ikuwe , isikuwe , kuna benefits , na future ya Sheng ni nini sasa now that sikuhizi kwanza kuna dictionary ya Sheng ( they both laugh ) . In Nairobi and it 's like Sheng yenye tunaongea ni kama hazifanani sijui kuna Sheng ya Nairobi , sijui kuna Sheng ya wapi ?
Na hata hiyo ya Nairobi bado ziko different . { Sheng ya Westland ni different }
{ Bado ziko different sijui ya wapi }
Na Sheng ya Kibera na Sheng ya Eastlands-
Ni different .
Sheng , has a very bright future . Kwasababu si kama kitambo . Unajua kitambo Sheng ilianza na youths . Ukisikia mtu , hata kama humuoni usikie Sheng ndiyo inaongewa , unajua that 's a youth . Siku hizi hata mapero wanaongea Sheng . Especially not even-and then ina spread . Kutoka : it 's origin is in Nairobi . So ime spread kutoka Nairobi imeenda mpaka in other towns .
Mmm hmm .
Halafu -okay that is spreading plus it 's being used by people of all ages . Katoto kado : go tu " njaa nayo " sijui " maubao " ( they giggle ) . Huenda hata sijui maubao ni nini na ni mtoto anakwamb " mom ! Eh maubao yamezidi " Sasa unashangaa . So as much as personally I would n't-eeh , I do n't speak Sheng . And aah , if I had the powers , it would be scrapped off from every- everywhere language is mentioned . Cuz finally itapiganiwa tu na itakuwa-ita- it will be recognized as a language .
Yea , and I think Sheng tends to : -tends to destroy Kiswahili .
A lot . Now that is where I have-you know that statement I have made is very personal . If I had the power I would scrap it off .
Scrap it off .
Yes . From every context we are-as in anywhere language inatumika .
Mmm .
Sheng will spoil sarufi , sintaxia , fonologia , inaharibu kilakitu . And the way I said , we do n't realize we are speaking in Sheng . Just the way you are speaking English , halafu unaongea Kiswahili , automatically . Hauoni kama ume codeswitch . So hata Sheng imekuwa part of us . Unaongea tu . Mtu akikuuliza unaongea ? Si nimeongea Kiswahili ? na uliniuliza " si unacome ? " Sasa unacome ni lugha gani ? Na si Kiswahili .
Eh hee .
Yea . So it has a bright future on the basis uh , that it 's spreading really fast and it 's being used by toddlers who can speak , to the aged . So iko na future ya bright sana but .. it 's a disaster to : languages , English included .
Mmm . And what 's your opinion about gayism , lesbianism ? Now that it 's something that , it 's in our society . Si kama kitambo tungesema " ahaa , kuko west " . Nowadays wako hapa and .. I hear nowadays they even have kind of language they speak . Kama watu ni ma homosexual , mahomo-ma-au { gays na lesbians-}
{ Even their dress code speaks . }
Yea their dress code . Hata language yenye wanaongea , what-wha-what do you think is the future ?
Eh , and the way they are fighting for their rights . Lesbianism and gayism and homosexuality , I do n't know which stand I would take . But like I have come to learn , there are so many factors that result to someone being gay and to another person being a lesbian . From the bringing up , to sexual experiences at a tender age , to the society itself . So : it might be legalized in future . Because nowadays they are coming out in public . Si kama kitambo eti ukisikia mtu ni gay mpaka mnamtoroka . Siku hizi they have their own associations , they have ah , days that they remember and celebrate , kama-kama in Nairobi there 's a newspaper I was seeing unapata all of them are male but , in-gays [ uncertain transcription ] the one who plays the role of a woman , they 're in dresses . Dinner dresses and make up . In public ! So hisi kama kitambo penye ukisikia yule mtu ni gay , hata yeye mwenyewe hawezi sema , he will die with the feelings . Nowadays they are fighting for their rights with the media , newspapers , eh transexuals ndio hao , so they might be legalized in future here in Kenya . And uh , I think .. it 's upon a person .
Okay , we 've come to the end . Thanks for your time .
Thank you .
