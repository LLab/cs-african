Welcome to this uuh , discussion . And we sha-we shall just be discussing only language and language use .
Okay thank you .
And so to-uuh-you said that you : -you do B.A. Kiswahili ?
Yea , I 'm a BA Kiswahili { student } . Yea .
{ student } . So maybe we can uuh speak Swahili a little bit ? Or something .
Yea , it 's okay .
It 's okay . Aah jambo la kwanza ni kwamba ni lugha gani ama ni lugha ipi haswa hupenda kuongea wakati uko na familia yako â€¦ pale nyumbani ?
Aah , pale nyumbani unajua .. aah , lugha haina-haina ulazima kutumika kirasmi . Yea so nyumbani ninaongea lugha ya mama . Sana sana tunatumia lugha ya mama , kwasababu hiyo ndio lugha ambayo kila mtu anaweza kuielewa . Yea .
Ukitaja lugha ya mama , inamaanisha kwamba wale wote katika familia yako wanaelewa lugha ya mama ?
Yea , lugha ya mama inaelewa [ uncertain transcription ] na kila mtu . Nyumbani .
Na akina dada ama akina kaka , wale ambao wanaelewa Kiswahili ama Kiingereza .
Aah sasa tukifika kwa hao , ukweli lugha tunaitumia kwa njia nyingine tofauti . Yea , haina ulazima saana kwamba lazima tutumie lugha ya mama [ uncertain transcription ] ni watu tulio na umri mmoja tumesoma tunaelewa lugha zaidi ya moja , kwa hivyo tunazichanganya . Yea , tunaongea Kiswahili , tunaongea Kiingereza , kidogo tunatumia lugha ya mama , lakini zaidi sana tunatumia Sheng . Yea , katika yale mazingira ya nyumbani . Tukiwa nyumbani nao .
Ni kwasababu gani haswa ?
Aah , sababu moja inafanya tuna : changanya ni kwasababu : -aah-sisi kama sisi , sababu moja ni kwamba tunajua lugha zaidi ya moja . Kwahivyo ukijua lugha zaidi ya moja na upate kwamba yale mazingira yatakuruhusu kutumia lugha zote , unabidi umechanganya . Wakati mwingine , tunaweza changanya kwasababu ya kuficha kama ni siri kutoa kwa wazazi . Unajua mara nyingi-mara nyingi wazazi huwaga hawaelewi lugha ya : watoto wanayo itumia . Kwa hivyo inawezekana kuna kitu cha siri ambayo tunataka kuzungumza na wazazi wapo . Kwa hivyo inabidi tunachanganya ili ku-kuficha mada kidogo .
Hivo mnatumia lugha gani hiyo Sheng ?
Hapo tunatumia lugha ya Sheng , na lugha ya Kiingereza wakati mwingine .
Sawa , sawa . Na wakati ambapo uko na marafiki wako huwa unatumia lugha gani na ni kwasababu gani ?
Aah tukiwa na marafiki hapo tena mjadala unakuwa ni mwingine . Yeaa , lugha tunatumia tupendavyo . Hatuna mipaka . Yea , tukiwa na marafiki tunaongea lugha ya Kiswahili , lugha ya-lugha ya Kiingereza , na lugha ya Sheng kwasababu : -sababu moja inafanya tunachanganya hivyo , wakati mwingine ni kujitambulisha . Yea , unajua lugha ni kitambulisho cha jamii . Kwahivyo kuna lugha fulani utakayo sikia watu wakiongea , na lugha hii itawatambulisha kuwa watabaka fulani . Au ikawatambulisha kuwa ni wa kiwango fulani . Kwahivo wakati mwingine tunaongea lugha fulani ili tu-ili itutambulishe sisi na tabaka fulani au kiwango fulani . Kwahivyo sanasana tukiwa na marafiki tunachanganya hizo lugha tatu : Kiswahili , ambacho pia wakati huo watu huwa hawatuangalii sana usanifu wake , tunaweza tukakiharibu tu kwa kupenda . Yea , Kiingereza hivyo hivyo . Na Sheng tukichanganya hivo .
Hivo niulize marafiki wako unaweza sema ni wa kiwango gani ?
Aah , bila shaka kiwango kipo . Uumm , labda ningeongelea kiwango nikirejelea : =
Masomo .
kiwango cha masomo . Marafiki zangu wengi ni wa : kiwango cha elimu ya juu , chuo kikuu . Yea .
Kwa hiyo hata wakati ambapo mna : -mnausanifu ama uwiju wa lugha , umesema kwamba mnaweza kiaribu tu kimpango hivyo =
Bora tuwasiliane . Yea , bora tuwasiliane . Unajua wakati mwingine ukizingatia usanifu sa : na unaweza ukapata kwamba labda kuna tatizo la : .. mawasiliano . Kwahivyo kule kuharibu , unaharibu lakini unajua unaharibu . Lakini kitu-kitu unacho kitacho ni kwamba uwasiliane . Ki msingi tuwasiliane . Kwahiyo kule kuharibu ni kurahisha tu mawasiliano . Yea , unaharibu ukijua lakini unataka upitishe mawasiliano .
Kuharibu huku [ uncertain transcription ] ujumbe kwa urahisi ?
Yea , bila shaka . Kwasababu ukizingatia kanuni kwamba lazima nitumie msamiati huu ipasavyo inawezekana mwenzako haufahamu . Kwahivyo unajaribu ku-unaona-unaona-unaona-unajaribu kushuka chini kidogo . Yea , wasizingatie ile usanifu sa : na ndio mawasiliano yawe rahisi .
Wale ambao wanatumia lugha kwa usanifu , huwa wanaangaliwa vipi ? Pengine na marafiki zako .
Aah-aah , kwa mfano katika : kitengo changu mimi , katika kozi yangu ninayoifanya tunajaribu sana , sana , sana iwe-kadri iwezekanavyo kutumia lugha sahihi . Sasa wale wanaouzingatia huo usanifu kwakweli wanachukuliwa kuwa kama ni maugwiji ? ( 5:50 mins ) katika lugha hiyo . Kwasababu ye haaribu msamiati , hachanganyi lugha ya pili . Yea , hakuna-hakuna huo mchanganyo kwahiyo wanaotumia lugha vizuri wanachukuliwa kuwa ni maugwiji katika lugha hiyo . Kiwango chao cha : umrilisho wa lugha kiko juu . Naam .
Ule umilisi wa lugha
Naam .
unatagemea nini ?
Aah , umilisi wa lugha : =
Ama ni vipengele vipi ambavyo unaviangalia wakati una-unazingatia uhim-umilisi wa lugha ?
Aah , ku-kuzingatia umilisi wa lugha kwa kweli tunaangalia vipengele mbali mbali vya kisarufi . Kwa mfano kuna kipengele cha kisarufi kinachoitwa : morfolojia , kuna kipengele kingine kinaitwa fonolojia , kuna kipengele kingine kinaitwa semantiki , na kingine kinaitwa sintaksia . Kwa hivyo umilisi wa lugha unatokana na hivyo vipengele . Kwa mfano katika morfolojia tunaangalia maumba ya maneno . Hiyo inaitwa kwa-kwa-kwa kimumbo word structure . Kwa hiyo kama unatumia maneno katika humo ambalo linafaa ?
[ uncertain transcription ] umezingatia ki-umezingatia kipengele cha morfologia ?
Fonolojia ni jinsi ya kutamka . Yea . Jinsi ya kutamka , matamshi yako yako vipi ? Yea , kuna zile sauti ambao zinakaanganya . Unapata katika mm makabila mengine sauti kama la[uncertain transcription ] , wao wanasauti [ uncertain transcription ] . Kwa hivyo kama ni kalamu je , unatamka kalamu [ uncertain transcription ] ama unasema " karamu " ? Hicho kipengele cha fornolojia .
Mm hmm .
Tukija katika semantiki , tunaangalia maana . Umemaanisha nini ? Je huo-huo msamiati ulioutumia unamaana gani ? Semantiki . Na mwisho sintaksia ni mpangilio wa maneno katika sentensi . Je sentensi ulioitamka au huyu hicho kifungo cha maneno ambacho umekitamka , kimefwatilia mpangilio mzuri wa maneno katika hiyo sentensi ? Ili kwamba maana baadaye ijitokeze . Kwa hivyo ukipata mtu ambayo anazingatia hivyo vipengele vyote ndo tunasema sasa huyo ni mtu ambaye ana umilisi wa lugha hii hapo .
Mm hmm .
Naam .
Bali na : matumizi ya lugha , pengine na marafiki wako . Humu shuleni huwa unatumia lugha ghani ?
Aah .. unajua matumizi ya lugha yanaenda na muktada , context .
Context .
Yea . Kwa hivyo inategemea ni muktadha gani . Kwa mfano kama nimo chumbani mwangu , lugha naitumia ninavyo penda . Unapata labda nazungumza Kiingereza na wakati mwengine unaweza ukafikiria hata mimi sikifahamu Kiswahili kwasababu pia umilisi wa Kiingereza [ uncertain transcription ] unaweza fikiri labda ninao zaidi , ya Kiswahili . Wakati mwingine utanipata nazungumza Kiswahili wakati mwingine pia naweza zungumza hata lugha ya mama . Naam . Kwa hiyo inategemea zaidi , na muktadha , na kama niko darasani na mwalimu amo , lugha naizinga-nazingatia ule usanifu wa lugha . Yea , kwahivyo matumizi ya lugha sana sana yanategemea ni muktada gani unapo itumia .
Mm . Kiingereza . Umetaja Kiingereza .
Naam .
Wana : -ya kwamba ni muhimu , kwa vyovyote vile kwa mtu-kwa mtu kujifunza Kiingereza .
La ! ( laughs )
Kwasababu gani [ uncertain transcription ] kujifunza ?
( laughs ) Yani , bila shaka ni muhimu sana . Ni muhimu sana kujifunza Kiingereza . Kwasababu waswahili wanasema kwamba " aliye na mbili havai moja " . Leo utavaa hii , kesho utavaa ile nyingine . Kwahivyo ni muhimu kujifun-kujifunza lugha ya pili tuseme labda Kiingereza , kwa sababu kuna mazingira ambaye yatakubidi ukitumie . Kuna mazingira ambamo utafika na we kama ulikuwa unafahamu Kiswahili pekeyake basi uka poteza ule uwezo wa kuwasiliana . Kwahivyo ule ulazima kutumia Kiingereza katika mazingira fulani ndio una-unatupatia umuhimu wa kujifunza Kiingereza . Sababu ya pili , umm-sababu ya pili ya kujifunza Kiingereza ni kwamba , wale wanafunzi wanao somea Isimu , ambayo ni linguistics =
Linguistics
Yea . Linguistics . Sasa katika isimu inasemekana kwamba huwezi ukawa na umilisi wa lugha moja bila kuwa na umilisi wa nyi-ile nyingine . Ni kwamba hizi lugha zinategemeana they 're in-interdependent . Lugha zinategemeana . Unaweza ukatumia Kiingereza kujifunza Kiswahili . Unaweza ukatumia Kiswahili kujifunza Kiingereza . Kwa hivyo inakuwa ni muhimu kujua lugha zaidi ya moja . Sababu lugha hizi zinat-zinategemeana kwa kiwango kikubwa . Sasa ukapata msamiati kwa Kiingereza lakini ukushinde wa Kiswahili ama msamiati [ uncertain transcription ] Kiswahili , ukashindwa kueleza Kiingereza kwahivyo ndio maana hata unaona : kuna haya makamusi ya lugha mbili . Unapata neno msum-aa : -kuna : -kuna [ uncertain transcription ] katika lugha ya Kin-ya-ya Kiswahili imeelezwa kwa Kiingereza . Ama nyingine kwa Kiingereza imeelezwa kwa Kiswahili . Kwahivyo lugha zinasaidiana katika kukamilisha mawasiliano . Ndio hivo kwahivo ni muhimu sana kuwa na-kujifunza lugha zaidi ya moja .
Hivo unasema pia kwamba ukijua lugha zaidi ya moja , ule utafsiri wa lugha nyingine =
Ni ya : -unakuwa rahisi ..
Unakuwa rahisi .
Unakuwa rahisi . Naam . Na : hakuna mipaka . Huwekei mipaka . Aah ukiwa na umilisi wa lugha zaidi ya moja , bila shaka hakuna mahali ambapo utazuiliwa kwenda . Kwasababu utaenda katika mazingira fulani utapata hao wanaongea Kiingereza . Kama hukifahamu bila shaka [ uncertain transcription ] nao . Maswali yoyote utayaacha . Utaenda mahali kama kinachozungumzwa ni Kiswahili na hukifahamu utahisi kama you 're alien-alienated , yea as in . Yea , utahisi kama huko pamoja na hao tena .
You 're out of place .
You 're out of place . So : to prevent this alienation in terms of aah : -ah , using language as a form of identity , then it 's important for us to-to have-to-to know more than one language . Yea .
Ulitaja kuhusu ule lugha moja kuathiri lugha nyingine ,
Bila shaka .
Mm hmm . U-huhisi ya kwamba ukijifunza lugha zaidi ya moja , ya kwamba nyingine itaadhiri lugha nyingine ?
Mm , hapo sasa .. athari zinatokea kweli , lakini inategemea hizo athari zimetokea katika muktadha upi . Kwasababu kuna mahali fulani ambapo kuna mazingira fulani ambayo yatakuhitaji utumie lugha fulani pekeyake . Na kuna mazingira fulani yatakuhitaji lugha hizo ukazichanganya . Sasa kwa kawaida aah , si rahisi kupata wazungumzaji ambao wanapenda lugha zote . Utampata yeye lugha ya pili anaifahamu ndio , lakini haitumii sa : na . Kwahivyo kila mtu unapata anapenda lugha moja . Ingawa ile nyingin-ile ya pili anaifahamu lakini sio kwamba anaitumia sana anaifahamu tu apate maarifa ya lugha .
Lakini anauzoefu tu wa lugha wote .
Ana yani-yale mapenzi yake zaidi . Akiulizwa kwamba " sasa leo kifo kinakuja jitambulishe na lugha " . Utampata mtu anajitambulisha na lugha moja , kwamba " mimi labda nikufe na Kiswahili . " " Mimi labda nife na Kiingereza " . Na sio kwamba hizi lugha hazifahamu zote , zote anazifahamu . Kwahivyo inategemea we wewe umependa lugha gani zaidi . Na : kama sasa hau-huna utambulisho wowote kama mimi napendelea ya lugha hizi-lugha fulani zaidi utapata sasa lugha zinaathiriana zaidi , zaidi , zaidi , zaidi . ( you will now find the languages are effecting each ohter more ) . Naam .
And let 's talk about a native language . Do you think it 's important for one to know a native language ?
Very , very important . It is very , very important . Um , for people to know their native languages because in the first place um , these native languages are-they act as identification . Yea . They help you to identify yourself with a particular group or with a particular group of speakers . So for one , identification is very important as a human being . And langauge is one of the ways through which people identify themselves . So you can identify yourself using a n-a native language . Ah , something else-umm-is about aah-we-we-we-we can talk about umm-as a community . Yea you know in the community ah , they feel-they feel that togetherness when they use their native language . These other foreign languages can be used but then they see that one as corruption of their own language . So that feeling of the-the sense of belonging to one community makes it important for that community to-to have the-fru-i-it 's-influence of [ uncertain transcription ] using- from local language . Yea so the native language is very important . One as a form of identification and then it kind of builds that togetherness in the community . Bringing people together . They feel as being one .
Okay .
Yea , when you speak the same langauge with somebody else then you feel the just one thing , that unity is strengthened . Yes .
Kuchanganya ndimi .
Kuchanganya ndimi .
Wewe huchanganya ndimi ?
Aah , ye mi huchanganya ndimi ( laughs ) . Ah , utagundua kwamba hata katika mjadala ambao tukonao hapa kwa njia moja ama nyingine tumechanganya ndimi . Kwahivyo mi huchanganya ndimi ndio . Na inategemea pia ni wapi . Yea , kwa mfano nikiwa naongea na mwalimu wangu wa : kozi yangu , nikichanganya ndimi hapo nitakuwa-nitakuwa najishusha hadhi , kidogo .
Kwasababu gani ?
Aah , kwasababu unajua mwalimu anatarajia kwamba-mfano kama ni mwalimu wa lugha anatarajia kwamba uwe na umilisi wa lugha . Mwanafunzi wake amfanane yeye . Kwa hivyo mazingira yakiwa ni rasmi kama mazingira hayo mnaoongea na mwalimu wako ni rasmi , { basi} =
{ Lugha iwe rasmi }
Lugha iwe rasmi . Lakini kama ni nje ya mazingira rasmi kuchanganya ndimi sio tatizo . Naam .
Umeniambia kwamba wewe uchanganya ndimi .
Bila shaka nachanganya ndimi .
Lugha zipi haswa ndio wewe huchanganya ?
Aa , kwa kweli siwezi nikajinasibisha na Sheng . ( I can n't relate/affiliate myself with Sheng )
Mm hmm . Sababu gani ?
Aah ( both laugh ) . Yea , siwezi nikajinasibisha na Sheng kwasababu mi mwenyewe nahisi ule uzalendo wa Kiswahili ambao niko nao nahisi kwamba nikitumia Sheng kidogo nitakua nausaliti .
Utakuwa unajishusha hadhi ?
Yea , I 'll be-no , as in I 'll be betraying , I 'll be betraying the language I stand for . So : -aah , katika mazingira rasmi utanipata nimeongea Kiswahili sanifu . Katika mazingira rasmi ya Kiingereza unapata naonge Kiswahili ya ras- I mean Kiingereza rasmi . Kwahivyo kuchanganya ndimi kwangu , ninachanganya ndimi ninapo ongea Kiswahili na Kiingereza haswa . Kiswahili Kiingereza . Hapo nachanganya ndimi Kiswahili-Kiingereza ama Kiswahili na lugha yangu ya mama basi . Lakini Sheng =
Umeshachanganya Kiswahili na lugha yako ya mama ?
Bila shaka , bila shaka unajua ,
Ni mazingira ipi ambayo hukufanya uchanganye ndimi haswa ?
Aah , kuchanganya ndimi : kunasabaishwa na sababu kadhaa . Sababu ya kwanza ambayo inafanya mtu akachanganya ndimi bila shaka ni ule uwezo wa kutofikiria msamiati f-halafu katika lugha moja . Kwa mfano kama unaongea Kiingereza na sasa huna mda wa kufikiria la-labda ulikuwa una-una-unaongea maneno fulani ukafika kwa neno fulani ikakushinda kwa Kiingereza . Lakini ukalikumbuka kwa ukaribu sana kwa Kiswahili basi unabidi umelichomeka hapo . Kwahivyo ule ukosefu wa mda wa kufikiria msamiati faafu ( appropriate language ) utakao utumia katika lugha hiyo hiyo moja . Basi . Jambo hilo linakufanya , linamfanya mtu achanganye ndimu . Yea , na pia inategemea unaongea na na : ni ... Aah , wakati mwingine unaweza changanya ndimi kama unataka unataka kusisitiza hoja . Yea , unaongea lakini unahisi kwamba ,
Hujaupitisha ujumbe .
Ujumbe haujafika . Yea , yule unae mwong-yule unaemsemesha labda unahisi kwamba hujampitishia ujumbe vizuri . Kwahivyo katika zile harakati za kusisitiza inabidi mtu amechanganya ndimi . Yea , kule kusisitiza . Yea , kusisitiza ujumbe unafanya mtu anachanganya ndimi [ uncertain transcription ]
Na wewe ufanya hivyo =
Mi pia hufanya hivyo mara nyingi . ( both laugh )
Now have you ever noticed ... the difference in the way you speak and how other students talk maybe ?
Sure . Ah , differences in speech exist . Um , differences in speech majorly originate from the environment somebody grew in . Like it 's very evident that somebody who has grown up in the-in the village .. uuh-the : -the level at which that person manages English or Swahili or both , is different from aah , the way somebody who grew up in the-in the town does . So : -aah , differences in speech exist just because of the environment [ uncertain transcription ] , and then sometimes the accent . Yea , the accent . People have different accents . So you realize that the way I speak is not the way you do . Just because we have different accents . And then , look at uuh , the two forms of-the two systems of English you have . Aa there is this British English then there 's the American English . So if you 're first introduced into English language using the American type , then you-you 'll grow up using the American type . And somebody who was introduced into language using the British type will also do the same . So you realize the two : -both are English but they 're two different . So sometimes that is a reason .
And you do notice that you can-you speak differently ?
So much . So much . So much . { Yea , sometimes when} =
{ What could-what could be this } uh , difference ?
Uh the difference could be on how we pronounce words . Yea how you speak your words out .
Okay .
And then the speed at which we-we speak these words . And then , most importantly the accent .
So that if you-if you heard somebody talking even before seeing that person can you tell that this and this person comes from this area ?
You 're right , it 's true . It 's true . Umm .. but they do n't-like in Kenya , we : have more than forty two ethnic groups . So it 's very possible for me to tell that whoever is speaking in the background is a Kamba . Because of how they speak , their accent is different . Where they are speaking mother tongue , where they are speaking Swahili , where they are speaking English the accent is different from how you tell a Luo speaker . Yea some languages are very heavy , as in the words come out with aah certain magnitude . While some languages are very light . Yea , the words come out very light . So you are able to tell somebody that the-the-that the-I mean eh you 're able to tell who speaks in the background if you 're-you 're able to hear the voice . You 're able to hear how they-the person pronounces words . [ uncertain transcription ] to tell .
In this case you 've heard the person speak .
Yes .
You 've heard the voice .
Yea .
Yea , so the issue is can you identify ,
Sure .
that they come from this area ?
You can . You can just by use of accent , yea . Especially if you : -i-i-if you guys exist within the same ecosystem . If you exist within the same environment like if both of us are Kenyans . And then you hear somebody speak at the background you 'll be able to tell that maybe that one is a Kikuyu speaking , that one is a Luo speaking , that one is this tribe speaking . Yea , just because maybe you 've interacted with these people before . Or you:-you 've lived with them or rather you 've just interacted with them and then you know how they speak like , um-take for example you grew up in Rift Valley . Umm , and there maybe let 's say we have the Kalenjins . Yea , you have the Kalenjins dominating the Rift Valley . Then let 's say that the other place you grew up maybe in primary school you were with the Kalenjins in secondary school of course there is intergration of communities so you maybe you had some people like the Luos , you had like the-the Kambas , you had like the Kiuks . So you are able to tell , because of the interaction you had before . So you know , ah , like the Luo speak this way . This is how they speak . This is their accent . The Kalenjins they 're a bit light and a bit haste .
Okay .
Yea so somebody speaks you 'll be able to tell ah , the kind of person speaking if at all you:-you 're in a position to get their words .
At least if you ever heard such a per-such a group of people speak .
Yea , at least if you ever heard . Yea , you 'll-you 've-you 've interacted with such people before .
What if-what if uhh , such a person is speaking sort of this neutral languages { that } do not belong to any ethnic group ?
{ Neutral } . Sure like aah Swahili ?
At least to-at least in the Kenyan case . Like Swahili and English .
And English , yes .
Can you even , can you tell in that instance that this person also comes from such and such an area even if they 're to speak in English or Swahili ?
Sure because .. umm , linguistically they exist . Or linguistic studies among the different Kenyan communities have revealed that there are some communities in Kenya that lack some-some alphabetical letters like you realize a certain community lack an ' l ' . A certain community lacks ' s ' , letter ' s ' . And a certain community uses ' th ' for ' sh ' . So if-if at all you have this uh-you are well acquainted with these linguistic evidences , [ uncertain transcription ] other observations that have been made and you hear somebody speak . even if it is a neutral language . You 'll be able to tell that this-ah this person comes from this particular area . Yes .
Katika jambo hilo ,
Naam .
Kiwango cha elimu .
Naam .
Ukisikia wakiongea , waweza jua kiwango cha elimu ?
Aah , bila shaka , bila shaka . Kama nilivyokwambia mwanzoni ni kwamba lugha inakuwa ni kitambulisho . Sio kitambulisho [ uncertain transcription ] kwamba watoka kabila gani . Sio kitambulisho kisha kwamba wewe ni wa wapi . Lakini ni kitambulisho cha utu wako wote . Na huu utu pia tunaweza tukaingiza elimu hapo . Of course mtu ambaye ameshika tuseme : -ameachia elimu ya msingi . Jinsi ambavyo atatumia , hata kama ni lugha ya Kiswahili ambayo imezoeleka kwa sasa , utajua kwamba kiwango chake cha elimu ni shule ya msingi . Kwa mfano , katika matumizi ya msamiati atatumia tu ule msamiati ambae umezoeleka . Ina maana huyu mtu haja bokoa mada , hajabokoa vitabu akaona msamiati [ uncertain transcription ] ambao unatumika sasa . Kwa hivyo atatumia tu ule msamiati ambao umezoeleka katika mazingira yake . Aliefika labda kidato cha nne pia unaweza ukamtambua . Na bila shaka mtu wa chuo kikuu .
Ambae amebukia mambo .
Ambae ( both laugh ) . Yea , kwa hivyo tunapima hilo kuringana na jinsi hio lugha imetumika . Unaangalia usanifu wake . Aah , tofauti na usanifu , pia kiwango cha msamiati . Kiwango cha-kwa mfano aah , tukiongelea kiwango cha msamiati utagundua kwamba hata katika uandishi wa ( 00:27:44 ) wale watoto wa darasa la nane , wale wa shule ya msingi , ndio wanaambiwa kwamba watumie ule msamiati mikubwa mikubwa , ile misamiati mizito mizito yakusumbua akili . Lakini ukifika : -ah , shule ya upili unaambiwa kwamba hizo ni dhana potovu . What we is communication ,
Yea okay .
It does nâ€™t matter aah =
The-the-the =
How heavy the word is , the vocabulary . So what we want is you can just use the light language but you communicate . But [ uncertain transcription ] the primary school they 're told we want vocabularies . So kiwango cha msamiati pia , kwa : njia fulani kinaweza kukwambia kiwango cha elimu cha mtu . Kwa mfano ukipata unaona huyo mtoto wa darasa la nane . Akakusemesha Kiswahili , eh ? Wale wanafunzi wa Walla bin Walla akakusemesha Kiswahili ( he laughs ) .
Utatafuta :
Utajua tu { kwamba huyu } ,
{ Kamusi }
Utatafuta kamusi kutafuta maana ya msamiati . Amemaanisha nini , na msamiati huupati . Kwahivyo mara nyingi , umm-tunapima kiwango cha elimu kwa kutumia lugha tukiangazia usanifu zaidi . Usanifu zaidi . Na lile lengo kula mawasiliano .
Naam .
Naam .
And the position in the society , can you tell from how that person talks ?
The position : -the position as in aah ,
Maybe the status ?
Oh the status . Of course language-lang-language and the recent past has become a [ uncertain transcription ] on the status of the society . Like aah , in the Kenyan context it is assumed that those people who speak English are of higher status than those who speak Swahili and other languages . All those people who speak English and other foreign languages are of higher status than these which speak the local languages including Swahili . So it 's possible to tell the status of somebody using the language they talk . Yes .
Now can you even tell their profession maybe ?
Sure . Umm , you see the profession really affects language use . Language use is really affected by the profession . Like you realize that aam , those people who maybe work in the courtâ€¦let 's take for example the lawyers , they 'll try as much as possible to-to use the language that have-the-they always use in their profession .
Okay .
So they words they use or the way they talk you 'll be able to tell . Come to the police , the same thing . You 'll-you go-you go to : the medical profession , people talk-somebody talks as if they 're practicing that profession . Unless they 're these-aah-unless the talk is con-contexualized , but otherwise the profession can be manifested in how you talk . Yea , like teachers . Teachers let 's say like the linguistic teachers , they are very , very serious and they really want to speak the right-as in when they talk they want to talk the right thing . Just because of the effect of linguistic in them . So you 'll hear a linguistic teacher talk you 'll be able to differentiate this linguistic teacher from the:-mm-let 's say the chemistry teacher .
Okay .
Yea because the linguistic teacher will want to be exact . Yea he 'll [ uncertain transcription ] to be exact but this chemistry teacher could use scientifical-scientific terms you know ? Yea so you 'll differentiate the-the profession , yes .
How about the political affiliation ?
The political affiliation and language ? You know that 's again aa-umm-a different context . Like when you talk about aah-the politics , we know the way they use language , what they talk is opposite of what they do .
So it may not be real .
It may not be real =
You cannot tell from what they say .
You cannot tell from what they say . Yes , because their language is full of ironies , their language is full of aa-you know-umm- kule kutia chumvi sa : na . So what they talk is not what they do . So that is just a language use . They just use language for the sake of communication . Yes . So with politics .. just dirty like that .
Okay , so I 'm saying if you-if you just heard somebody speaking , maybe without you seeing that person , can you tell the kind of aah-the kind of party maybe that person is affiliated to ?
Sure , you can be able to tell because we are looking at umm-aah-this patriate is into [ uncertain transcription ] certain political party , so if you hear somebody talk , like aah , let 's say in the Kenyan context . Somebody who is aah-aa-against the Jubilee , let 's say the Jubilee coalition , will always not talk positive of it . So it 's about the positivity , how positive is this person in the speech if it 's not in the negative way then you 'll know , I 'll be able to tell the political affiliation of this person . Yea . So ,
Umetaja kwamba unaelewa kama unailewa lugha tofauti ,
Naam .
Umetaja taj-tak-takribani lugha tatu .
Bila shaka .
Lugha ya mama , Kiswahili , Kingereza .
Na Kingereza , ndio .
Waweza ongea lugha hizi tatu kwa watu tofauti ?
Yea , bila shaka :
Yategemea nini haswa ?
Yea , aah-lugha ya mama .. aah , bila shaka nikikutana na mtu ambae ni wa kabila tofauti na langu .. aah-itakuwa sisaidii sana nikimsemesha na lugha ya mama . Kwahivyo lugha ya mama ninaitumia na wale watu ambao wanajua , wanaifahamu . Kwasababu ukimsemesha mtu na lugha ambayo haielewi hapo huwasiliani . Itakuwa ni kama unamtukana , kwasababu haelewi unachokisema . Kwahivyo lugha ya mama kwanza naitumia na watu ambao wanaifahamu . Na hao ni wale wa kabila lako , wale wa pale nyumbani . Kiswahili pia : unajua ni kama imekuwa hasa ni lugha ambayo inafahamiwa na-inafahamika na kila mtu . Kwahivo nikikutana na wao ambao sio kabila langu , huifahamu lugha yangu ya mama , aah Kiingereza hukifahamu bila shaka ntakusemesha kwa Kiswahili . Kiswahili pia naweza ningekitumia katika mazingira ambayo ni rasmi zaidi hata nje ya huu mjadala . Nje ya : -aah-labda mazingira ya nyumbani tuseme hapa shuleni katika mhadhara ( lecture/public talk , discourse ) wa shule . Mhadhara wa chuo . Hapo tutaweza nikatumia Kiswahili . Kiingereza nacho .. nakitumia sana sana labda kuwasiliana na wale watu ambao najua hawafahamu Kiswahili , hawafahamu lugha yangu ya mama au anafahamu Kiswahili lakini nahisi kwamba nikiongea Kiingereza labda ndio atanifahamu zaidi . Atanielewa zaidi . Kwahivyo natumia lugha hiyo . Kwahivyo matumizi ya hizi lugha zote tatu zinategemea ni nani unaemsemesha , yea . Labda kwa kabila , ama kwa umri pia . Yea , yawezekana hata mtoto ni wa darasa la tatu .. mtoto wa darasa la tatu ambae si wa kabila lako . Kiingereza labda hakifahamu kwa hiyo unabidi utumie Kiswahili . Au anafahamu Kiingereza zaidi ya Kiswahili unabidi utumie Kiswahili . Kwahivyo unaangalia ni nani unamesemesha , umri wa huyo mtu na ni ujumbe , ule ujumbe unaotaka kuupitisha . Je utaeleweka zaidi vipi , ukitumia lugha gani ? Yea , so : [ uncertain transcription ] with this person-ah-as in the message you want to pass to this person . How do you want it to be understood . So kama ujumbe unataka ueleweke vizuri zaidi na unahisi nikiongea Kiswahili labda ndio huyu mtu atanielewa zaidi so you use Kiswahili . Nikiongea Kiingereza labda ndio atapata ile maana [ uncertain transcription ] naitaka aipate mimi kwahiyo namtumia Kiingereza .
From your experience , in the Kenyan context â€¦ okay if you met a stranger maybe you do n't know whether this person understand English or Kiswahili , which language would you start speaking to that person ?
Well in the Kenyan context-ah in the Kenyan context aah-of course we know that if you 've gone to school , if you 're learned then you 're well conversant with English and Kiswahili . But ah-if you 're not then at least you know Kiswahili . So in the Kenyan context withouth having known the-the level of education of this stranger it 's better for you to start with Swahili . At least it is-it is a local language . So you-you 're convinced that maybe this person could be knowing Swahili . So you start with Swahili . Yea . It 's advisable or it 's-it 's actually good to start with Swahili . Yea .
Are there instances in which you might be forced or you might be tempted to speak English to this person and what really determines ?
Umm , well , aa-if this person is actually a stranger , you 've never met this person before , aahm-just the outlook , the appearance of this person , as in you know the outlook also determines the status of somebody . So meeting a stranger the outlook itself will tell you the kind of language you 'll use . You might be forced to use English if you-if you really feel and see that this person might n't be aware . Yea , just becuase of how you see the person . Because there 's somebody that you can meet and then you just defeated on what kind of language to use and does this person know English or does he know Swahili ? But most probably you 'll just come to a conclusion let me use English . yea , in most cases it has happened . You use English and you realize this is an English person .
And in most cases you say that depends on the outlook .
Yea , it really depends on the outlook . How-as in the-how-how-how-the first impression you have of-about this person .
What is this thing that really makes us think this person understands English ? Is it mode of dressing , the way he carries himself around ? ( both laugh )
Actually when you talk about the : -the first impression the person creates on you and then â€¦ I-you look at is this person presentable in the first place . Yea , presentation I mean how is he dressed . Yea , just even the walking style what does he have with him ? Like you just see somebody carrying a : -a laptop bag so you think it 's [ uncertain transcription ] the laptop inside . Then I really think you 'd be convinced that this person knows this kind of language .
Kwa wale mahustler mengine ? ( both laugh )
Hawa mahustler wengine sasa ( they continue to laugh ) , mahustler wengine inakuwa-inakuwa tatizo kweli kujua anatumia lugha gani . Mahustler inakuwa shida .
Ni : Kiswahili
Sheng
Sheng
Yea .
Mambo kama yale
Mambo kama hayo .
Now , we 've talked about the difference in the way we speak . Have you ever tried to change the way you speak ?
Sure . Aah , it has mostly happened . Um , you know the way we speak .. just depends on who you are speaking to . Like you take for instance you 're speaking to : -aah let 's say a Standard Seven kid . The mm-the-the language that you use to speak to this person , even if it is English , it will be to the level that this person understands . Aah , if you go a bit higher and look at a Form Three-a Form Three- [ uncertain transcription ] a Form Three student you decide to speak English or the English that you 'll use umm-must be to the level of this person . Come to the university and here we also use English according to who are you speaking to . You 're speaking to the lecturer , are you speaking to your fellow students , so it 's about the level .
Oh , okay .
So you change according to the need . You change according to the need . And sometimes , umm , even in the normal circumstances like when I 'm speaking to a lady , to be open I â€™m speaking to a lady . I just do n't-I just do n't pick words . If I have to select , yea , and you have to-to organize your tongue in a way that the words come out with-with-with certain-certain melodious voice , you know ?
And you can do that perfectly .
Yea , it happens ! ( they laugh )
Okay .
Yea , it 's possible , very possible .
Now since you came to this institution can you say that you have changed the way you talk ?
Sure , I 've changed the way I talk because .. umm , of the kind of people I 've interacted with . You know you just uh-you just listen to somebody talk and the acc-the accent touches your attention . The accent itself catches your attention . You-you-you attend a conference-you attend a conference and then you hear how people talk and then it 's like I really feel the person uses a very good English . You know English yourself , yes but the level at which and the accent [ uncertain transcription ] that person speaks aah-speaks that language is so good . So you feel like-you feel like you have urge in yourself to speak the same so you start training yourself . Just another matter of practice , practice , practice [ uncertain transcription ] time you find yourself speaking that way .
Okay .
So ther-the aah , the aspect of changing how I speak of course how I used to speak English in aah-let 's say high school is not the same as I speak now . There is a very , very big difference . That 's because you know , in the university you meet different people you may share various experiences and sometimes you also have umm , these contests . Like conferences where you organize speeches . Like public speaking . So such has helped me to change how I speak my let 's say English today .
Okay . And you aspire to perfect it eventually ?
Soo much , so much . My aspiration to perfect how I speak-I think is one of the things I 'm working on . Yea .
Why would you think it 's important for one to be perfect ?
Aah it 's very important for one to : per-perfect the way they speak just because you 'll be required to use this aah , this perfection somewhere else . Let 's say for example right now we-we 're here in MOI University . But some other time you may-you might be required to work even the United States . So it 's very important for you to : -to : -to pronounce these words well , the way they are supposed to be pronounced . The way they are supposed used structurally , not just the light English . When someone hears you speak and then they ask themselves " is it serious ? " . So it 's very important because you 'll-you 'll be required like for us scholars we interact with different people . We aspire to go beyond where we are . So we have to-to perfect the way we speak because of the change in need . Yes .
Do you notice the difference in which other people speak â€¦
Yea .
The English language maybe or Kiswahili ?
There are differences . As much as for myself I 'm trying so much to perfec t-t o perfect my own speech but actually listen to somebody talk , yea this one is talking English but which kind of English . Is it just that light or is it tha t-t hat deep ? Yea so from the way they speak you can be able to tell , the [ uncertain transcription ] . Yes .
Na mbali na hayo , ni mambo yapi ambayo wewe na marafika zako huwa mmnaongea siku hizi ?
Aah , sasa hivi : -mengi ambayo tunaongea sasa hivi yanahusu mahusiano , relationships
Relationships .
Yea , relationships . Aah , mambo maswala ibuka , of course these ah , emerging issues .
Emerging issues .
Yea , maswala ibuka . Wakati mwingine : siasa . Politics . Yea , like the current situation of Kenya hayo utatupata sana sana . [ uncertain transcription ] ni ma : -ni mahusiano , maswala ibuka , aahm siasa na masomo . Masomo . Mmm .
Kwanini mnayaongea kuhusu mambo hayo ?
Aah , they 're part of us . Hakuna vile ambavyo unaweza ukaipuka . Swala la ma-la mahusiano , relationships . Hata ukiipuka basi , kunanjia fulani ambayo tunayaongelea . Kwahivyo unaongelea lile jambo ambalo linakuathiri sana and aah , that which affects you . Look at relationships . They affect us so much . Look at the emerging issues . They are really with us . Look at politics . Look at umm , umm studies . So we just have to talk-talk about them because they are there with us .
When you talk about relationships in which forums especially ? I know you have friends both .. male { and female }
{ And female } yes .
Now do you talk about the same issues when you only male or when you female or when you 're in a mixed group ?
Aaahmm , actually depends on what you 're speaking . But like for our case you know we adults now . Yea we 're grown ups I believe . Aahmm , sometimes under-under normal-normal situations aah we can be talking about relationships when we are with our .. in a mixed circle . Things like jokes which [ uncertain transcription ] relationships they 're on-they 're normally there in a mixed-in a mixed setup . But ah , for example when it 's kind of [ uncertain transcription ] like you 're talking about the opposite-the opposite gender , then we 'll ah-we 'll mostly do that when we are just men alone . Yea . When we 're men alone we can talk about ladies . Yea but when we 're together then we just mix up issues . Yea .
And there 's a difference in the language you use when it 's a man forum and when it 's a mixed forum ?
Sure . Yea , you see like when it is a mixed forum people will want to seek recognition . Normally people aah-will want so much to seek recognition . So the level of [ uncertain transcription ] they use in that aah-in that context is different from like when you are just men alone . Yes . Cuz to seek that fame and recognition somebody aspires to-to use a little bit a different language it would put that person into the status they want .
And you 've seen this working ?
It has worked so many times .
Okay . Now â€¦ in this-in this-in this uhmm , forums especially in mixed forums , who normally dominates the-the whole aah , program ?
Well : -aah-male . Men-men does that . Yea , ah in most cases men . It 's men who dominates the forum . But sometimes , sometimes there appears special cases where ladies are talkative so it actually-it 's not actually constant who dominates . It depends on-on the-on the-on the context . Yes , sometimes men dominate and then few-a few instances you may find ladies doing the same .
Why-why do you think this happens ?
Like for male-for male dominance as I sa-as I said earlier it 's about aah recognition like they 're ladies around , you know , they 'll want to be seen as aah-as the head . So : those who knows much . So I think ah , ah the reason of seeking recognition and fame from the opposite sex , yea , drives men into this dominance . And sometimes ladies also you know they have that perspective that they 're undermined . So she thinks when she talks much then she 'll be heard . So sometimes those are the reasons .
Yea , you talked about umm-topics that are rather gender insensitive .
Yes .
What is normally their reaction and how do people behave especially when the topics are gender insensitive ?
Well , aah-you see like if we take aah-an example of aa-this environment [ uncertain transcription ] . You know this environment that has awakened-awekened the female gender . So they know their rights at the moment . They know what they 're supposed to be of course they 've read ah-they 've read about the feminism and-and all that [ uncertain transcription ] something like that so , they know . So when anything to do with gender insensitivity seems to appear , they raise up . They raise up . Like I remember-I remember the other time ... we had done a course on aah-umm-sex and gender . I was in my second year of study . Sasa wakati huo-yea wakati huo-aah I remember ladies in my class-ah before then ladies in my class as in you could just bull them . You could bull them the way you want . You 'd distract them and they do . But after the course-after the awakening , the course-the course had such an impact on them that they now stood up to tell us we know our rights , we appreciate ourselves as females and we know that we are as equal as you . And that 's why you realize in Kenya right now , aah , the big issue is about gender equality . Even in the government although it 's no t-t hough it has not been accomplished . But gender equality is the thing right ? So in a-in a-in a situation where aah-it 's-it is-it is seeming that gender insensitivity is arising then these ladies really stand up for themselves . Yes .
Now do you have any role models as far as language use is concerned ?
Sure , sure , sure , sure , sure . Aah , I have quite a number . Umm , right from my high school .. aah , to university and in Kenya and the world . Ah from high school I remember my English teacher , teacher of English . In university [ inaudible name ] , I realized uuh , professor Kembo Sure , the first time I heard him speak , I just thought-I just had the desire for myself to speak as him . While in Kenya , though com-though complicated but I like how Lumumba speaks . In the world , aah I really desire to speak like Obama . Yea , so in language use those are the people [ uncertain transcription ] .
What aspect especially do these people have ?
The accent , you know ? How-how they speak . The way they-they give out these words .
How the pronounce the words .
How the pronounce the words . It really touches me . I really feel like-well it 's not that complicated but the way it comes out that accent is so-is so perfect .
So you think that should be the basis of knowledge of English . That if you just know the way you pronounce , then =
No I really do n't think so . You know , aah-the basis of any language is communication . The moment a language loses its communication value then it 's no longer a language of course . So what should be the basis actually is communication . But then in addition-in addition to that communication we should be looking at how this communication is done . Eh because effective communication goes hand in hand with effective use of words , effective conversation and all that . So the basis , the source of all communication , be able to communicate something . And then in the second place now we look at how , how have you done it ?
Okay . That 's great . That 's really interesting . Now we-back to-to end that discussion . I really want to appreciate the fact that you came to give this information . And be sure that the information that you 've given will be so useful .
Thank you .
Nimeshukuru sana .
Karibu .
Haya .
Eh nashukuru .
