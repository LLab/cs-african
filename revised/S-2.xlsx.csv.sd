Okay , asiqale phansi . What languages do you use at home ?
Aah , it ’s isiZulu
Okay =
Because it ’s the language I was brought up in . Ah , most of my family , we all speak isiZulu .
Okay , ja , oh , how about the language that you use with your friends ?
Ja , I use mostly isiZulu and English .
Mhhh =
But here in school , ja- coz- ja sometimes I code-switch .
Ja =
Between the two , ja .
Mh , alright . Eh , how about lapha eyunivesithi , what language do you use ?
I use English mostly =
English kakhulu ?
Ja .
Why Inglishi kakhulu la eyunivesithi ?
Coz- coz most- coz most of the module im doing , ah- ah-
English modules ?
Yes , are English modules .
Okay , alright . Ah , ucabanga ukuthi is it important ukuthi khona nomuntu azi isiZulu ? I mean English ?
English ?
Is it important ukuthi umuntu azi i English ? Why ?
Yes , I believe so because I believe English is a universal language . Coz it ’s- despite your background , despite your home language you can- you can connect with other people from different language , languages . Like for instance if you- someone is Sotho , you do n’t understand Sotho or Venda-
Mh .
The language that connects you two is English .
Okay
Ja .
That ’s powerful , hhe ? Ah , do you think it is important to- to- for anyone to know his mother lang- ulimi lwakhe lokuzalwa , ulimi lwebele ?
Ja , I believe so coz without- without knowing your basic language , I believe that you do n’t have a strong foundation coz you do n’t know who you are coz they say you must know where you come from before you know- before , ah you know what you want in life .
Ja exactly . That ’s true . Ah- ah- do you mix several languages in one conversation ?
Yes I do . I do especially when I ’m speaking with my friends . Ja , sometimes I swi- I code- I mix Zulu and English . And sometimes I mix tsotsi style and languages-
What makes you to mix , why do you mix it ?
It ’s- coz it ’s because it ’s the language that- coz I usually speak- mix- ah- English and Zulu coz it ’s language that I mostly speak so it just happen unconsciously .
Mh .
Ja on-
No , that ’s true . Have you noticed any difference between the way you speak and how other students talk ?
Oh yes , I do coz some- some other people like those ah- those people who are- have been raised in the- in the modern- in the modern way- like those who- ah- who (…) for instance those who- like if you are a Zulu person then you went to an English school , the way they speak if- if- if mina ngi- I was- I went to the government school where- where- where- we were taught English in Zulu . My Zulu wont be the same as the one who taught in English school =
Okay =
You find that they are fluent when they are speaking , and sometimes they do n’t mumble like I do . So it ’s- ja it ’s a huge gap .
Mh . Okay , can you tell if somebody is from your area by the way he talks ?
Definitely ,
Mh .
The way we talk and especially the Zulu people the way- when they speak =
Mh .
You can tell the way- because their vocab it ’s- it ’s so- it ’s deep , and it ’s- sometimes they really stumble with words . Ja , sometimes- i- ja- you can tell by the way they speak =
Okay , no that ’s great . Ah , if you just heard someone talks without seeing this person could you tell what kind of background , whether he is educated or whether he 's got high position in society or whether he ’s a politician or whether- can you tell ?
Yes , ja I can tell by the choice of word they are using .
Okay =
Coz some- some people- especially those people who are academics they use those words that are- those advanced words .
Mh =
Like- just to show up that the- they- they are educated . So ja , you can tell , ja .
And then , ah- do you speak different ah- languages to different people , where , when and why ?
I speak different language ah- ah- because I was brought up in the- when I was raised to respect elders , when im speaking with elders , I would respect the manner that is n’t appropriate manner that ah- I wo n’t- I wo n’t speak in the same level as I was speaking and- and others . Like- when im speaking with a friend , umngani wami ngeke ngikhulume ngendlela efanayo nomntomdala =
Ja
So I have to change to show that I am respecting that elder and when im speaking with my friends sometimes I ’ll mix English and- and isiZulu and if ah- coz- for me im flexible- I would like- I would like to learn about other cultures , so if I found ah- ah- I speak with a Sotho or- or Xhosa , sometime I do speak Xhosa or Sotho with that person a bit just to show that I really acknowledge that person .
Mh =
Ja , so- ja .
Mh , that ’s great . And then ah- ah- have you ever tried to change anything about the way you talk ?
Yes , especially when im speaking English =
Mh .
Coz I feel that ah- english makes you feel good when you speaking it the way ah- it ’s just the society that describe when you are fluent in English , when you pronounce those words nicely they think that you smart you know-
You are accept- you ’re acceptable .
Ngiacceptable , ja .
Okay , ah- okay- right . Just basically , what are the issues maybe that you discuss with your friend nowadays , the burning issues =
Burning issues ?
Mh , that you discuss with your friends now ?
I would n’t say issues- okay- I would say , soccer .
Mh , soccer yes .
Okay , ah- we talk about soccer mostly and especially with our careers .
Ja .
Ja , the way and ah- the- the- coz (…) we think about the- ah , we planning about our life coz now we are at the stage at the-
Okay =
Ja , we are- we ’re at the university you have to plan for the future =
Okay , which year now are you in ?
Me im doing a third year .
Okay , it ’s your last year
No , it ’s gonna be a four years .
Four years ?
Yes .
So what ’s your plan when you finish ? Going to the field or doing a postgraduate study ?
No no , for us- for us coz im- coz this- there is the thing if you are Zulu , if you are boy , you are raised- ah- is that like you- unesikweletu ekhaya you have to fill .
Okay .
So I have that gap , I have to and- and- go and definitely find work and ren- and raise-
Raise your family ?
And raise my family , and just , yabona- renovate the house and then- and then go and leave my house- and to start my own family .
Okay .
