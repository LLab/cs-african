Soo , eeh thank you for your time this afternoon . We : are going to discuss issues to do with your language use .
Alright .
In everyday life when you 're in the hostels , when you 're at home . So feel free to discuss anything you feel is relevant , okay ? To-to how you use language .
Alright .
Soo , I 'll start off by asking you how-what languages do you use with your family ? What language or what languages do you use with your family ?
My family , I use Kipsigis . I use Kipsigis with my family . Yes . { With my mother} =
{ Why ? Why} =
With my mother and father I use Kipsigis .
With your mother and father how about your brother and sister ?
My brother and sisters English , Kiswahili , Sheng or Kipsigis sometimes .
Okay .
Yes .
Why-why do you think you use Kipsigis for your parents and not for your brother and sisters ? Why-why do you think you ?
They understand that better .
Mm hm . Do n't they understand Ki-Kiswahili ?
They understand =
Wanaelewa Kiswahili ?
Yes .
They can talk Kiswahili .
They talk Kiswahili { they can talk English }
{ They can talk English ? Uh huh }
But { I find it }
{ But why do you think}-yea-what-huh ?
I find it too formal . When I speak Kiswahili or English it reminds me of a formal situation . It 's better said if I speak it in Kipsigis .
But why do you want to be formal with your brother and sister ? Kwanini u-utumie =
It 's-it 's not formalilty . They might not be understanding Kipsigis quite well .
Okay .
Yes . And then some =
So you 're more comfortable with =
And then the kind of language tha t-t he kind of talk that we have it 's not the ones for requesting something . It 's for informing .
Informing . Ah-okay-so-but you also said you use Sheng with them . Which is not a formal language .
Yes .
And even the-the English that you are saying you use with your brothers and sisters , would it be what you 'd call { standard } English ?
{ Standard } . No . No . No , it 's not .
So you 'd mix =
It 's a mixture
Uh huh , of what and what ?
Of Sheng , though I use =
What is Sheng ?
Sheng is colloquial language .
Colloquial language .
Yes .
And usually it 's a mixture of Kipsigis also in the Sheng , is it ?
Yes , there 's some Kipsigis words that I can Shengilize ( she smiles ) I can put them in Sheng .
But mostly which languages ?
Kiswahili and English .
And English . Eh heh . How about with your friends ?
My friends ?
Especially at-around home .
At home ? Kipsigis .
Kipsigis .
Yea . [{ uncertain transcription }]
{ So you come }
[ uncertain transcription ]
So you come from an area that is .. predominantly- watu wengu huko ni-wanaongea { Kipsigis . Everybody talks Kipsigis }
{ Everybody talks Kipsigis }
Eh , you do n't have people- you-you have a few people =
We have a few Kisis here and there . We both [ uncertain transcription ]
And you do n't have friends who are Kisis ? Hauna marafiki kutoka =
From Marau who are Kisis , no . No .
So you use Kipsigis basically why [ uncertain transcription ]
Like I said talking in English , now the standard kind of English would be too formal . Yes , and then most of them , most of them who are include my friends back there , they have not reached my level of education .
Aah , so sometimes it 's also they do n't understand English .
Yes , yes . Or I- you might speak English in a certain way I can say that =
What do you mean ?
Najifanya [ uncertain transcription ]
Okay unajifanya eti " Eh ameona-anajiona sasa ni wa campus "
[ uncertain transcription ] " ameenda sijui wapi . "
" Na alikuwa tu mtu tunaongea tu na yeye kitu kawaida " =
[ uncertain transcription ]
So you try to avoid =
So I try to avoid that kind of thing . Yes .
How about your friends in school ?
Here ?
Yes , is it the same ?
No , it 's not the same . These are people who-
Yea , so ?
These are people went to school so if I weng in English or Kiswahili or whatever kind of language I use , they 'll understand .
That 's interesting , you do n’t-you do n't just speak English you weng . Wow .
( She laughs ) Sometimes you have to .
What makes you do that sometimes ?
Just [ uncertain transcription ]
Ah huh , you-you want to show them that you =
Not show off . Yea , just comes-
It just comes naturally . So aah-which languages-you did n’t tell me you just said [ uncertain transcription ] which languages do you use with your friends to speak ?
Aah , English and Swahili and Sheng .
English , Kishwahili-English , { Kiswahili and Sheng } .
{ Kiswahili and Sheng }
Aah , okay . But … English and Kiswahili , you said Sheng is a mixture of English and Kiswahili so when you say English , { Kiswahili }
{ English }
and-what-would-is there some situation where you are speaking to them in English that is pure English .
Pure English .
Yea . { Which situations are those ?
{ We would do it in an office , }
Mm hmm .
If we are in class we are discussing something if we have-if we are in a group discussion and we have to get things done . Something serious .
Kiswahili , how about { Kiswahili , is there a situation} ?
{ Kiswahili , in the corridors} =
Mm hmm . And would it be Kiswahili that is … {standard }
{ Standard }
Yea , like good Kiswahili . Pure Kiswahili .
Yes I-I-personally I try to use standard Kiswahili .
Eh he . So corridors . { Which corridors is} =
{ Yes , among the corridors . Here} =
Which building ?
In this School of Arts Buidling . Eeh , Student Center .
Eh he , library ? What do you use in the library ?
Library ? English and Sheng . Yea and sometimes =
How about Sheng ? Is Sheng =
Sheng ?
When you are talking to your friends in school , where would Sheng come =
Come in .
Yea .
Out of classroom setting , when we 're in stage . Yes .
The shopping center ? Yea ?
In the hostels . Yea .
So you-tha t-t here it 's just Sheng , Sheng , Sheng ?
Yes , when we 're next to an office and we do n't want whoever is inside to listen to us ( she laughs )
Aah , okay . So these people in offices do n't speak Sheng or do n't understand Sheng ?
No , that 's how Sheng , that it 's just latest . Yea I can say something and I might be talking about [ uncertain transcription ]
I 'm sure you 'd lose me also ( both laugh ) . If you do that then I would also be lost .
I am also not so good in Sheng but I have those very basics that at least [ uncertain transcription ]
You will also pick because you-you will interact with =
Yea I meet them =
So you mean there are people who are really good in Sheng here on campus ?
Yes . Very good .
Very good . Sometime you do n't even =
Sometimes-yea-sometimes I do n’t get so I have to ask them " So what does that mean ? " They explain it to me and
Now-now English , do you think English- ni-iko na maana sana ?
English ?
Yea .
Iko na maana .
Is it important ?
Yes , it is very important .
Very important .
Personally I will take somebody seriously if they spoke to me in English , pure English or pure Kiswahili . If you speak to me in Sheng , it 's a little bit informal and I will not take you seriously .
So you feel knowing English is important
It is very important =
Cuz you told me that there are friends at home who do n't speak English . Why is it important for you to know English ?
To know English . In this educational setting it is important . That is what I use for everyday speech , everyday : aah what else
You mean in school .
Yes in school . Everyday to acquire the kind of knowledge that I have right now I have to use English to get whatever it is that I want [ uncertain transcription ]
What is it that you want ?
When I am coming to requests , maybe a lecturer cuz I 'm going to request for something I willl have to speak in English . And they will take me seriously , that is how I will get knowledge or information from them .
But these friends of yours , what is your home called ? Your home area ? { Your village } .
{ Sotik }
Oh Sotik is your-is your-is that constituency or [ uncertain transcription ]
Constituency .
Constituency . So these friends of yours in Sotik , are they disadvantaged do you think , because they do n't know English ?
Somehow , yes .
What are the disadvantages they face ? Simply , the reasons that they do n't know English .
First of all I do not discuss with them anything educational or anything serious . It 's just the informal stuff with them .
Because I think for me I think I-if I go there I find them living usually they eat , they drink they wake up they do their things . I do n't think-the English is not really affecting their lives .
It depends on also what you want . If it is [ recording goes completely unclear here ]
Mm hmm . If it is ?
If it is in an educational set for example you wil have to have that English . If you intend to visit an office you have to have that English . Yes . [ uncertain transcription ] maybe they do n't need to-maybe they highest office they can visit is the chief 's office . Of course they will speak Kipsigis because of the surrounding . And also the chief understands that these people are from the village and so he has to use that kind of language . But now for me I 'm in the two settings . When I 'm there I use the Kipsigis , when I 'm here =
So you feel you 're in a better- uk-uko mbele , you are : -that 's what you said
Yes .
You are better position than- { than them }
{ Than them }
How about if I tell you that eh-the-the native language that they speak or their mother tongue is also important . Would you agree ?
Yes .
That to know a native language is important .
Is important too . Yes .
What-why is it ?
It gets things done for them .
Mm hmm . Not just for them even for you or any-or anyone-or anyone . Is it important for them to know a native language ?
It is important .
What is-why do you think it is ?
It is important because eeh-first of all it 's an identity . So :
What is this identity thing ?
This identity-belonging essentially belonging to somewhere .
If you did n't speak Kipsigis for example , would n’t you-do n't you think you 'd stlll say that I 'm from Sotik ?
No . It 's-but I 'll be better placed if I am a Kipsigis I come from Sotik and I know the language . Because when I go { and talk to those people }
{ So without knowing the language }
I will fit in . Yes .
So you =
It helps me fitting in the situation .
So you feel if you did n't have-if you did n't speak Kipsigis then you 'd sort of be out of place ?
Yes , I 'd be out of place , I would not fit in . Yes . There 's nothing much that we can share . Yes .
Okay but out of Sotik , what is the importance of-of [ uncertaint transcription ] , because you 're-it 's like you-when you say the importance of your Kipsigis is you 're referring to Sotik . How about out of Sotik ?
Out of Sotik ?
Why is it important ? What is the importance ?
[ uncertain transcription ] maybe-okay my answer is [ uncertain transcription ]
Kwanini ? Why are you ?
Because , uuh why is it important that I know Kipsigis when I 'm in [ uncertain transcription ] . It 's like there 's that kind of identity too the one that I had said I sense . Aah , what else can I say ?
Because if like-let 's go back to those the languages I asked you about , that what languages do you speak with your friends in school . Is-is Kipsigis some-sometimes also-you-because you said English and Kiswahili , Sheng . Do you sometimes use Kipsigis even in school ?
Yes . If I meet a Kipsigis person .
If you meet a Kipsigis person . And why-why would you do that ?
Why would I speak to them in Kipsigis ? It 's something we have in common . Makes you feel closer to =
So you walk to a room like this and you find five people , two of whom are Kipsigis . Would you speak to them in Kipsigis ?
Yes .
Uh huh . Why would you ?
Though , when I enter the room and I ask you " hey you are-you are a Kipsigis ? " Then I 'd be like " yea , wow so where do you come from ? " Other than , if it 's a Kipsigis and a Kisi . For the Kipsigis I will tend to ask more . I 'll ask them " so where do you come from ? Okay so what do you do here ? "
So you identify more with-with this .
Yes . With them . But for the Kisi " yea , so hey you are classmates ? Okay . "
That is the end of =
That is the end of the story . Yea .
How about like .. you-you-if there 's this Kisi there 's of course there-there-there 's two Kipsigis and then there is a Kisi maybe somebody from the coast and or somebody from Luhya . And you want to tell these Kipsigis something that you do n't want-would you do that ?
Yes , I will .
You would do that ?
I-I do that most of the time =
( interviewer laughs heartily ) So there are thing-things that you want =
I feel comfortable asking =
You do n’t want these others to hear ?
Yes .
Aah , okay . Soo-aah-so it 's also something of-of an in-group thing . You want to -to be-to speak with these people without { other people} =
{ Them listening } . It feels-it feels good . At least I belong . Yea , some things maybe I 'm saying something about them I will have to use Kipsigis .
Does this happen often ?
It does happen , trust me . ( both laugh )
But there are also things like you are in a-in a Kipsigis meeting . I know you-you have these associations where the Kipsigis students . And then you are with friends and then you want to tell one friend something but you do n't want the other one to … know-yea-or-yea . How-what do you do in that situation ?
In such a situation it 's hard . I would n't speak-I might not . If it 's a friend we are closer and we share some of these codes =
Then there are =
He or she might know that when I nod like this =
So you have codes [ uncertain transcription ] outside-out-because you told me I know English , I know Kiswahili and I know Sheng . So you also have other codes ?
Codes to accompany the language .
You mean like gestures
Yes . Yes . Gestures . Yes .
Or maybe-do you sometimes use certain words to mean something else ?
Something else .
Not necessarily the word what they are telling me .
Uh huh . Or I can use one word and it will summarize the whole sentence . ( interviewer laughs heartily )
And that friend of yours particularly { will be the one who } will understand there was a [ uncertain transcription ]
{ will understand } Yes .
That 's interesting . So you-you speak three languages ?
Yes .
Three .
Three .
Actually four . If we add Sheng .
Oh French . No .
Oh you also speak =
Five .
You also have French .
Yes , I also have French .
So do you-do you use these language sometimes =
Sometimes
In-in-in-in one conversation ?
Yes .
Uh huh . Tell me about that . When ?
In our French-in our French class .
When ? In-in a French class ?
In our French class sometimes you lack the words to say whatever it is because it 's not my first language so [ uncertain transcription ]
You are still learning French .
Yes , I am still learning French . So sometimes I wlll mix it with English . Yes .
So that you-you want probably to : ask " what is this called ? " in-
In French . Yes .
To a friend or-or your lecturer .
Yes . [ uncertain transcription ] is this very interesting scenario today when we were down here a group of us . HOD 's office . Um , there were some classmates [ uncertain transcription ] speaking in French . By then I knew about French { uncertain transcription ] because I had done it before . But now , we were in a situation where we were speaking with [ uncertain transcription ] the secretary [ uncertain transcription ] . So I would use a French word in an English manner . I would use an English word in a French way . I will use an English word to pronounce =
You mean with a different pronounciation ?
Yes , with a different pronounciation .
An English word with a French pronounciation and the other way around .
Yes . And the other way around .
Okay . So this is also another strategy of locking out { some people from your conversation . }
{ Locking out . Yea , we were locking out } . We did n’t want to hear . Actually we needed services from them and they were taking long so hey , [ uncertain transcription ]
I hope I helped out by the way .
That time ?
Yea .
You did . You did .
So umm-French now is coming in as something-because it 's a foreign language . Most people in Kenya do n't speak French . But you are lucky that you have attended classes you have learned French you can use it in that way .
Yes . Yes . Yes .
So it 's possible to lock out a secretary , somebody else because
Highly possible ,
Yea . How about let 's forget about this French . Go back to your mother tongue , English , Kiswahili , Especially English , Kiswahili . Do you mix ?
I mix .
Cause you told me that this Sheng is a mixture of the two .
Somethings the Sheng it 's just =
There 's Sheng that is Sheng =
A very foreign word that is yea =
That is just Sheng and then there 's=
There 's Sheng that is a mixture of =
But would you say it 's mostly- sana sana ni-ni-ni just English and Kiswahili words ?
No . No . No . No . Something like " ngori "
Ngori .
To me that-there 's no English word in that =
But I ’m saying =
But there 's no Kiswahili word like that .
With-with those words ni nyingi ama ni in the majority or in the minority ? Those that are =
The English words ?
No those that are purely Sheng like ngori .
Purely Sheng ? It 's less .
It 's less .
Yes .
So the majority is { English and Swahili } . Well that 's what I mean .
{ English and Kiswahili }
So you agree .
Yea .
So would you do that ? Would you mix the two languages in one conversation ?
Yes .
Where for example ? Or when ?
When ? When I 'm just being informal . When I 'm talking to my friends I would mix . Or when I 'm talking to somebody .. like aah-the workers in the library , those guys that help out . Yes . The { janitors }
{ Why do you want to}-to mix something just for them ?
Because when you speak in English you feel like you 're…[uncertain transcription ]
Why not just go completely Kiswahili . Now into Kiswahili because =
Kiswahili is hard .
Kiswahili is also hard for you . ( laughs )
Yes . [ uncertain transcription ] make a full sentence in Kiswahili [ uncertain transcription ]
( laughs ) So when you mix English and Kiswahili with them , it makes sense .
Yes .
For them .
For them . You also feel like you are coming to their level . Yea . If you 've gone around these places you will know how those people speak . Yea .
So you are =
[ uncertain transcription ] to use that mixture .
Tell me again which-which languages are these that you mix ?
English and Kiswahili .
And which other can you mix also ? You said French and English .
For-now for this certain thing [ uncertain transcription ] most of the workers in this institution are Kalenjin speakers so also some-sometimes , let me say half of the time I would use { Kalenjin } . Yes .
{ Kalenjin } . Just Kalenjin ?
No , not just Kalenjin . I would mix it with some English and Kiswahil . When I first approach I would use the mixture English , Swahili . But when I get to learn that you 're a-cuz I just assume that this person is Kalenjin . Yes , then I would use Kalenjin [ uncertain transcription ]
Have you-do you think that when you are speaking with-with-the-your friends , other students , have you noticed a difference from the way you talk and the way they talk ? Other students talk . Have you noticed a difference ? When they 're talking . Is there a difference ?
Everyone speaks differently . Yes .
What do you mean when you say everyone speaks differently ?
Like my friend . If it were-if it were [ uncertain transcription ] , I would speak-anyways-we know we are the same . You know there is this thing national schools versus national schools .
Yea , yea , yea .
We were in the same national schools .
On that level .
So there 's a way we 'll talk and you 'll understand . [ uncertain transcription ] my lady friend she has this mother tongue influence . Yes . So sometimes my talking and her talking they do not vibe . Yes .
Mm , so there is a difference between the way you talk and the way other students talk .
Yes . { Half the time} =
But { have you ever-have you ever } encountered mtu mtasema " that guy , he speaks like me " or " that guy speaks like another [ uncertain transcription] ?
Yes . I have .
So there 's=
But not here
Not here .
Nimeambiwa tu there 's this some kind of man not from here I was told " Yea , you speak like- yeye anaongea kama wewe " . So I was like " yea , now you speak then I 'll listen to the way you speak . ( she laughs )
But for you you know , you will not notice the similarities . Most-mostly differences between the way you talk and the way other students talk .
Eeh , I think there 's a difference . Yea .
Cuz if we are-if we are-we take somebody from Sortik like you . A girl , same age like you , same level of education . You are both here you 're on campus [ uncertain transcription ] on campus . Is .. there a difference from the way you talk and why would that difference be there ?
If somebody has that mother tongue influence .
Let 's assume there 's-you have both been born in the same area you go to the same schools so the influence is not there .
Maybe the voice , the :
Apart from the voice . Like for example language choice . Language choice . They choose certain words that you do n't use .
Yes . If it 's-if we 're acquring the same service we might end up using the same kind of words .
If this person you have come through the same-
Institutions .
Yes , institutions . But people from different institutions ?
You may-you might be different . There 's a language that might be unique to MOI university and somebody from ( she lists a number of schools . I can n't make them out ) Yea .
And eh-is it possible for you to tell where somebody comes from from the way they talk . From the way [ uncertain transcription ] talks .
You can tell .
How do you do that ? How is it that way-how can you tell I mean-
There has to be some bits of influence .
Influence . When you say influence what kind of influence are { you talking about ? }
{ Mother tongue influence }
So give me examples like-
Aah , Kipsigis or Kalenjin speaker they might have difficulties in pronounciation of some words maybe ' p ' or ' b ' . A Kikuyu might have difficulties with ' r ' and ' l ' which sometimes I also have because I stayed [ uncertain transcription ]
Aah because you said you said you studied in Kiambu .
I was also born .
Aah , you were also born in Central-province .
I was born in Eastern Province .
So you also =
So sometimes I also say ' r ' and ' l 's
When there is-when it 's an ' l '
Yes .
Aah . Okay . So you can tell =
I can tell .
How about without-without the mother tongue .
Without that .
Influence .
I can also tell .
Yea ?
Somebody from town and somebody from the rural areas .
How is that possible ?
With the Sheng . The Sheng comes in . Somebody from town might-not even the Sheng . Just Sheng and maybe English also . Somebody from town that is a little better-let me say better than somebody from the rural areas . Some vocabulary is a bit more advanced . And then the Sheng now . Somebody from the rural areas they just know the very basics of Sheng . [ uncertain transcription ] somebody in town their Sheng is just =
So you can =
Way beyond [ uncertain transcription ]
You can tell this person is from Sotik from the way they speak .
Mm ,
From the way they talk .
Now if you come to that , maybe the divisions they are sometimes .. uh , what do you mean ?
Let 's say this person is speaking Kipsigis . Can you tell that this person is from Sotik ?
Yes .
Like you .
Sotik . I would differentiate somebody from Sotik , somebody from Bomet and somebody from Kericho .
Uh huh ! From the way they speak Kipsigis .
Yes , from the way they speak . Somebody from : Sotik we are somewhere in between in our Kipsigis . Our Sheng is somewhere there . Somebody from Kericho they : -okay they do n't speak a lot of Kalenjin , they do n't speak a lot of Kipsigis and ah some words they say slow .
So it it because Kericho is a big ah-it 's the city now . Let 's call it a city or the bigger town then Sotik . What if somebody =
And somebody from Bomet , they just there . You know Bomet borders =
When you say they 're just there , what do you mean they 're just there ? ( both laugh ) They 're just there .
Somebody from Bomet , you know they border this very remote areas Transmara and Chapalungu if you 've heard ( 00:26:59 mins )
Mm hmm . I 've heard of Chapalungu that is in Bomet
Now that is where real Kalenjin speakers are . Real Kipsigis speakers are , yes . So theirs is really intense , deep . Some words I may not even understand .
How about somebody talking Kiswahili . Can you tell that this person is from Sotik , from where you come from when they-they talk Kiswahili ?
No . I think just Kalenjin speakers they way they-maybe the ones from Kericho . Kericho is a town yea so their Kiswa-Kiswahili might be more advanced than people from my village or people from =
So if you have two people talking Swahili one from Kericho and one from Sotik ,
There is a difference .
You will tell that this one is the Sotik one ?
Yes .
Eeh . From the way they speak their Kiswahili ?
Yes .
Tell me if-if you hear somebody talking . Without seeing that person . Can you tall from what area cuz you told me you can tell this person is from Central or Kalenjin land or whatever from the way they talk . How about when you can n't see that ?
You can also tell .
You can also tell . How ?
You-yourself you can n't tell that if somebody now-if a Luo- a Luo speaking person walks around this corridor and the way they speak and you will-do n't see them . { But I think} =
{ So it 's the accent again } that is helping you .
Yes , I guess so .
So you can tell the background of the person like [ uncertain transcription] =
Without { looking at them }
{ Without seeing them } . How about things like level of education ?
You can also tell the level of education .
How ?
Let me give you another case scenario .
Yes .
Professor Akiembo , he 's walking and speaking with eeh , who ? What 's her name , Lonyang 'a Pope * . And that eeh-this guy Mark and the other guy , they are also walking and talking the same same English . Let 's say they were talking in English . You will tell that " He ! That one is a little bit advanced and " =
Than this =
The other one . Yea . Somehow , somehow you can identify that way , for me .
So level of education by listening to somebody speak without seeing them maybe you can say this person ?
Yes .
This person is a professor . But this person is .. a cleaner , maybe .
Yes , yes . { You can tell }
{ But , but } if I-you have two professors . Akiembo-you gave me an example of Akiembo and another one . Can you tell that these people are both professors from the way they talk ?
There are some people who carry themselves mm-how do I put it … more learned ( she laughs ) , in quotes . Then =
{ Than others }
{ Others } Yes . Some it 's outstanding and for some it 's just subtle . Until they tell you " oh , he 's "
" I 'm actually " =
Or until you 're told .
So . Will those be in the rare cases or the-the-the more { the rare cases} =
{ I think it 's the rare cases }
So the majority of cases you 'll just say " This person is very well educated . This other one " =
Even the way they walk . Not just { talking} = ( they both laugh )
( laughs ) { Not just the way they talk} ! How do educated people walk ?
They do n't have time for so many-you know me the way I can walk or the way I am sitting here and then looking outside I have seen some bottles there , some books there . He might not-he or she might not even notice but they 'll say-they 'll-they will concentrate [ uncertain transcription ]
Are you talking about me ?
You ? No . ( both laugh ) It 's not you .
Okay . So some people will notice others will not ?
Yes .
How about something like somebody 's position in the society ? Can you tell somebody 's=
By the way they speak ?
By the way they talk .
Yea .
Does this apply to Englsh , Kiswahili and mother tongue . Does it apply ?
It does .
It does .
Eeh , the examples they will give it will be from their field . If it 's a doctor , the stories that they will tell you [ uncertain transcription ] those are the kind of stories they will tell you . " Nighttime nilienda wapi ? Nilienda sijui wapi nilipata hii case ya nini nini " . Yea .
Mm hmm . So from that you can pick =
In their talk . Yea , you can pick if they 're discussing maybe world news or anything . { Something} =
{ Or politics ? }
What ?
Can you use politics if they 're discussing politics can you say that " this person " =
If they 're discussing politics .
" Huyu ni Julbilee . Huyu mwingine , aah huyu ni wa ODM . " Is it possible to do something =
Yes . You will tell . Somebody from ODM will probably saying things that happened when ODM-the : manifestos =
Ok let 's say somebody dis-two people are discussing . A : -a certain topic that is political like MPs ' pay for example . Or a certain bill they want to pass in parliament . Can you tell that this one is Jubilee and this one is ODM ? Without them mentioning that I am ODM ?
Yes . Yes .
Why ?
It is so sad in Kenya that there are those divisions . A Kikuyu right now the Jubilee side 's Kikuyu and the Kalenjin . Of course I will support if it 's a Kikuyu or if it 's a Kalenjin whose in that posiition I will tend to support whatever it is they 're passing . { But if it 's from the other divide} =
{ So there 's a way that people argue } in a certain line that is aligned to their party .
In support of whatever it is that-yes .
So tell me again do you speak differently to different people ? Or different languages to different people ?
Yes .
For example when they 're people =
Differently ?
Yea . Give me examples .
Let me say-let me first say . If it was Dr. K-no , sorry , Professor Akiembo interviewing me I might be a little bit scared , composed or-not composed or shaking a little bit . But now it 's you and I had spoken to you earlier so it 's easier to talk to you . Now that you even interrupted you =
How about the languages ? I mean the langu-language choice .
The language choice .
That some people you speak to them in English and other people you speak to them in Kiswahili .
Yes .
Some other people you speak to them in Kipsigis .
Their level of education will determine that . Their-the setting where =
So in campus what languages mostly ?
It depends on who I 'm speaking to on campus . If it 's a lecturer , English preferrably . If it 's a worker it will be a mixture of Kalenjin , =
And Kiswahili .
English and Kiswahili . English in rare cases . If it 's a student it depends on where we are also . If it 's in class , English . And if it 's in class and the teacher is watching or listening it would be English . If it 's in class and it 's just our own chit chats I might use Sheng .
How about with-with students . Your-your fellow students . Do you feel like there are some students you will talk to them in English even if it 's in the hostel ?
Yes .
And others in-in-in Kiswahili or Sheng ?
Yes .
What determines that ?
Maybe level of interaction . If we rarely speak , I might speak to you in English . If we have spoken once in a while , maybe English or Kiswahili . If it 's somebody we speak with every-everyday or somebody I know I 'll use Sheng or any other language that is comfortable . If I know the person is Kalenjin =
So you 'll-you 'll-is it sometimes or some-some students just want to use English throughout ?
Yes .
How-why-how would you let them move ? How would you-what do you think about them ?
About those students ? There are students =
Are you one of them ?
Yes .
You are one of them who uses English =
Half the-most of the time .
Most of the time .
Yes .
Are those guys students who use it hun-most-almost a hundred percent ? Ninety nine percent ?
It cannot be a hundred percent .
Yea I am saying like nine-close to a hundred .
Yes , close to that , yes .
If you go to their room-it 's " Nisaidie hizo notes " [ uncertain transcription ] like " I do n't have them " .
Yes .
There 's such =
It 's easier . I think it 's easier to say it in English also because I 'm conscious of the fact that not everybody is Kalenjin or-yea .
No but Kiswahili-everybody speaks Kiswahili you can walk to a room and say " Eeh , nisaidie hizi notes zako " ama " Nisaidie a spoon ? " , no ?
Nikuzoea tu pia . I was in primary school and we never-we used to speak English from Monday to Thurdsay .
Mm hm . { Did you also have }
{ On Friday } .
discipline , because =
No . We had those punishment
Punishment for speaking =
For speaking in something else . Mother tongue .
So you got used to this business of speaking English ?
English . Yes .
Mm hmm .
Only on Friday were we allowed to speak Kiswahili . But we would just go maybe to parade sing the national anthem in Kiswahili then the rest of the day you would just use English .
Have you ever tried to change the way you speak-you talk ? Have you ever tried-anything about the way you talk ?
The way I speak , yes .
Can you-how-I mean why ? Or-or tell me a scenario like =
Eeh , how will I say it ? I have tried . That I have tried .
What was the motivation ? What was the reason ?
The interest in the person . ( she laughs )
Where was this ? ( he laughs )
Not in campus . Just within El Doret-somewhere else =
Yes , so there-there was interest in a person ?
Yes . More interest in person or somebody-somebody-somebody you like . You will change the way-I will change the way I speak .
To what ?
To … I might end up speaking in good English . Just English of course . [ uncertain transcription ]
So you will even adjust the English ?
Yes .
To be ?
I-when ( she laughs )
So you mean inside you will be trying to-to impress this person ?
Yes . Why not ? Why not ?
Any other instance ? [ uncertain transcription ] And does it happen also in the reverse or is it always you want to improve to the better or sometimes also [ uncertain transcription] =
It also depends on the kind of person . If I know this person is a doctor , a pilot I will change .
Mm hmm . But a lecturer no [ uncertain transcription ] kawaida ?
A lecturer ? Eh it depends on the kind of lecturer . ( she laughs ) If I go to-I just have to use at least [ uncertain transcription ] and where I speak with her casually eh she 'll look at me " Are you ? Are you okay ? " ( she laughs ) .
Yea , so =
But somebody like who [ uncertain transcription ] . I might speak to him-okay I also do n't want to underrate him . I know he 's a lecturer , I know he 's beyond me { so I} =
{ But there is some} =
But there 's also that kind of-
Familiarity and [ uncertain transcription ]
Yes . Yes .
So it 's possible to change the way you talk-in certain =
It is .
Instances .
Yes .
So I-you told me that you can do it to impress somebody . Can you also do it for example-you-maybe your English . The way you 're talking to me you English is good . Very good . But you meet somebody who is not very English , can you change the way you talk ?
Yes if I want to dismiss the person or [ uncertain transcription ] or as fast as I can .
How-(he laughs ) . [ uncertain transcription ] what you do ?
Just talk to them in English .
What if you want the opposite , you want to actually engage them ?
In a conversation ?
Yea .
You first listen to them . The way they talk and you go along with the way they are speaking . Yes . If they are being casual . You know sometimes there are also interesting but they 're not speaking in English .
Like you told me your friends in-at home . Their level of education is not at your level . So do you change-sometimes try to change to accommodate them ?
To accommodate ? Yea , if it 's really necessary that I change to accommodate I will . But if the talk is .. a little bit too low for me let me say that , I 'll just opt out .
Uh huh .
Yea .
What are the discussions that are going on now ? In-in-on campus what are you discussing with your friends ?
With my friends ?
Mm .
This very exam week I think it is just exam card , it is the clearance forms . What else ? Projects .
Oh you have to finish a project ?
Yes .
As soon as possible eh ?
Yes .
Eh heh . How about =
And then the kinds of discussions that we also have are the different lecturers and supervisors .
Oh you talk about them ?
Why not ? If mine is good and yours is terrible let me say that . Yea , we have to say something .
How about before-outside this [ uncertain transcription ] things . I 'm sure you have some things you also talk about in the hostels .
That 's easy .
Yes . Such topics like ?
Boys , men .
Eh heh , boys , men . ( both laugh ) What do you say about boys and men ?
We say about boys ? We have to categorize who is a boy , whose talking this ? Look at this fake men who does he think he is ?
Boys and men there 's a difference ?
A very big difference . ( both laugh )
Oh okay .
Do you know that .
Oh , okay .
Okay to me . To me I =
To you .
I categorize them that way . There are boys and there are men . And there are real men .
There are real men . Ah ! Boys , men , real men . ( she laughs ) Three categories .
Yes .
And so you-you 'd be discussing this with your friends .
Yea , not all friends also =
Why do you think =
Because =
Yea . Close friends ?
Do I even have very close ones ? Yea .
But [ uncertain transcription ] there 's somebody =
There 's somebody I have to say something cuz it 's sometimes you just have to say .
Yea , you have to say .
But =
Why-why would you like discuss this [ uncertain transcription] ?
It keeps the time going .
So it 's just leisure .
Sometimes it 's just too exciting to keep it to yourself you have to say it . Yes .
Eem any other topic apart from boys =
And men .
On campus ?
There 's work .
Apart from classwork .
Happenings . Anything that is happening within campus . Whatever . You can talk about home .
Yea ?
Yea . Your parents . { You can talk about something} =
{ Anything on TV ? }
Yea .
Anything on { radio } or anything =
{ Listening on radio } , TV , we discuss . Then the conversation just keeps leading to another discussion .
Do you discuss things like " After I finish my-my " =
Now , it depends . It depends .
This is what I want to do . It depends ? You do n't talk about that ? Because I know you are almost finishing soon .
If somebody is not .. uhh-let me say ambitious enough . You know you might have people who they never talk about =
They do n't .
Work . Yes . So you-such a person how would I start telling you " Oh , this is my plans after campus " no . But now somebody whose told me of " There 's this company I saw they were advertising " . I can tell such a person , yes , my plans .
What are those plans ? Can you share with me ?
Like for me ?
Mm .
Eeh . Interestingly yesterday my parents were-I was talking to them they told me that they can-[uncertain transcriptoin ] sponsor me for for masters .
Are you-are you excited ?
Not really .
Not really ?! ( both laugh )
The sponsoring part , yes .
But =
But now the part that I wanted first to go to the job market and =
You 're not =
Test first the waters before I know what I really want . So
Do n't you think masters is also testing waters ? Academic waters .
It is not testing waters . I cannot imagine myself coming to master in LMC [ uncertain transcription ] . What is LMC ?
Language , media and communication .
Yes it is language , media and communication but what do I like ? That is very broad . LMC is broad so I might decide =
So would you want to work for example ? What would be an ideal job for you ? What is =
For me ? First of all I 'm very flexible . If I ’m told to go to Turkana right now I will go .
Uh huh ?
Yes .
Wow . ( she laughs ) Is it because of the oil ? ( he laughs ) You know everybody wants to go to Turkana now .
I just said Turkana but even anywhere .
Anywhere in Kenya . Outside Kenya ? Sudan ? People go to Sudan . People go to Somalia ?
